Introductory Note
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
The Book of Power was originally transcribed by Idr(cid:1)es Shah from an 18th century manuscript, and he
(cid:1)
speculates that it has come, whether in this current form or not, from the Middle Eastern magical
(cid:1)
tradition. So far, there has only one text of The Book(cid:1) of Power has been found, Shah searched through
(cid:1)
many major libraries following up various rumours, but never found another copy. The text contains
(cid:1)
many interesting magical squares and cryptic referen(cid:1)ces to numerological systems, probably in this case
(cid:1)
the Arabic ABJD system. I have placed all of the footnotes at the end of the document, those by Shah I
(cid:1)
formatted in italics. I cannot vouch for the accuracy o(cid:1)f my Arabic renderings, but I have included them
(cid:1)
nonetheless.

I. To overcome enemies of every kind
Write this square, which follows, on white cloth with red or black colour. This is to be done at the New
Moon. Carry the spell with you, and it is better sewn to the clothing in the region of the heart. When it is
desired to overcome enemies, the word AIKAN [2] is to be spoken, with the head to the East; and the
twice again to the North and West. Here follows the square:
(cid:1)(cid:2)
(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:15)(cid:1)(cid:16)(cid:13)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:6)(cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:1)(cid:24)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:26)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:13)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:28)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:30)(cid:1)

2. To be revenged upon one that has done you hurt
Say RAIZINO [3] seven times, to the points of the compass, when you are alone, after nightfall. Then
take a blue wood pen, and write this square upon a dried, triangular leaf:
R A I Z I
I Z I A R
A Z B G D
B M M T M
[4]
When the leaf is complete, it must be burned in a lamp flame which has not been out for more than three
hours at a time. And there must be no other person within three hundred paces of you when you work. It
is best to do this in a place where no person visits, and always to carry with you a quantity of black cord,
ties around your right arm.
3. The killing of men by magic
There is great evil in killing by magic. It is not allowed by God, or man, and surely there cannot be any
doubt on this point. But it was done in times gone by, and this was the manner of their working:
A square with the number equal to seven times seven was made, and this was made in iron on a plate of
lead, and then was hanged in a running river for the space of seven times seven days. When it was ready,
it was brought by night back to the place where the experiment was to be made. Then there were needed:
a widow’s tear, the three first stones from the river bank, and shoes which had not been used for a year.
All these things were taken, and placed with the talisman in a box of wood which had been made without
nails. This was then buried, and the place where it lay was to be known to no man. When it was required
that the spell should work, the Worker made a picture of the things, and this he burned into a fire of
white wood, and he said the words over them. And these words were EOO EOO EOO MMOO

ADADBASANA And there words he said seven time(cid:1)s seven times, and then the man died.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
And when it was all done at night, it was better, and t(cid:1)here was nothing seen of it by others.
(cid:1)

A man was killed by another man by this square:

(cid:1)
It was written in white ink, made from clay and water(cid:1), and on a black cloth, and the man who was to be
(cid:1)
killed was to wear it near to his body. Then the man who was killing the other man writes it again five
(cid:1)
and twenty times, on green silk, with a black ink. And(cid:1) it was done three hours after the dark. And if the
(cid:1)
man wore it not, then he would only sicken, and die after seventy days. Otherwise he died in three days.

4. To travel instantly from one place to another by ma(cid:1) gic
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
The genie AMPHAROOL [5] presides over instant travel to all places, and he is the genie who was
(cid:1)
called by King Solomon [6] the King of the Genies o(cid:1)f Flying. "And he comes to you when you know his
(cid:1)
name, and I is thus": (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
A M PH A
(cid:1)

R O L A (cid:1)

M PH A R (cid:1)
(cid:1)
O L A M (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
And this is the way which it is done. Five days after the full Moon, five things are to be taken: and they
are five stones, each one from a place where no sun is seen. Then the magician, taking his hat and shoes
(cid:1)
in his hands, goes to a place where there are high winds, and he calls out In a loud voice, so that the genie
may hear him. And he calls upon him in these names: "AMPHA, ROLA, MPHAR, OLAM," as it is
written in the square. And the numbers of the words are also used. [7]
The genie will come, and he will be high, and upon his back is a sack. In the sack, if you ask for it, is the

Ring of Travel, and he will give it to you. And this ring is to be kept in a small woollen bag, and is to be
rubbed with quicksilver every thirty days. And when he comes, he is to be spoken to as an Amiyre, and
he is an Amiyre of the genii [8], and he speaks to you in all tongues, and also tells the manner of learning
them.
Later in the manuscript another -- and even more curious -- process for travelling instantly from one
place to another is included
To travel from one place to another, by flying as fast as the fastest hawk
This is a great secret, which was known to the sages of the earliest days, and it is known to some today,
though the art was for some time lost.
Take snow, and boil it with oil, on a fire of two kinds of wood (one white, the other red), and then put the
mixture in a bag made from a sheep’s bladder. When this has been in the bladder for a moon and a half,
allow the mixture to run into charcoal, and when all is taken up, powder it upon an alabaster table. This
powder is placed in a horn and when you want to fly, take a pinch of the powder and place it within the
pages of a book, and then put the book in your robe, in a place which has been prepared for it.
You will then take the book and sit with it in your hand, and think of the place which you are to fly. And
this takes longer at first. And when you are ready to fly, and will feel tired, and then you are to say,
"SISPI, SISPI," and you will instantly be at your destination.
When you want to return to the place from which you started, you are to say, "ITTSS, ITTSS," and you
will be back. And it is related of a king of former times that he used in this way to rule two lands, and
moved so rapidly from one to the other that it was not known until after a revolt took place and he had
fled from the first kingdom, that he was the king of two lands.
5. Protection from evil spirits and the mischievous
When you are performing a magical operation, whether it be of alchemy, or the white or red magic, it is
best always to have this square written on paper and bound to the left arm:
S D D D C
H T L T B
S D D D C
H T L T B

And this is the talisman that David gave to Solomon (cid:1)the King, and with it he first was able to become
(cid:1)
pure, and thus he attracted the first good spirit, and he brought the others to him, and he learned the
(cid:1)
magical arts. So it is of great value. (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
6. To stop any man, animal, boat or cart from moving(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
This talisman came from India, and it was there much(cid:1) used against the insurrectionists by the kings of
(cid:1)
that land. And when they learned it, they were able to rule without fear, and the enemies were unable to
(cid:1)
conquer them. (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
The square is written on a green leaf with another leaf, in yellow ink, at any time of the day or night:
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
1 21 63 7 (cid:1)
(cid:1)
21 7 1 21 (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
9 19 91 9
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
12 4 6 8
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
[10]
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
The use of this figure is simple and works at once. W(cid:1)hen you would use it proceed thus:
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Look at the bird, or animal, or man, or boat or cart, w(cid:1)hile holding this leaf in your left hand. Pronounce
(cid:1)
the words [sic] "1 21 63 7" [11] and then the words "12 4 6 8" [12] until they take effect, which is
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
rapidly. You must say the words quickly, and not in a high voice. And if there is any fear in you, or any
(cid:1)
doubt, this will not happen. For you must learn that d(cid:1)oubt is the destroyer of works of magic, and thus be
(cid:1)
careful of your processes and your fear.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
You must not tell anyone when you are doing this thing. If you tell one, then he must promise, in his
(cid:1)
blood, that he will tell no more than one person. And(cid:1) when you are working, your head must be covered,
(cid:1)
and if it is covered with a yellow cloth, it is better.
(cid:1)
7. To cause love between two people
Take three strings, one of each of the colours of earth, the sun and the moon. These are taken, and placed
tied together in a small jar of earthenware. When they have lain there for six days, add a little of the juice
of the jasmine flower.
(cid:1)(cid:2)
(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:15)(cid:1)(cid:16)(cid:13)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:6)(cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:1)(cid:24)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:26)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:13)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:28)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:30)(cid:1)

Press all together. From this will be made an ink, which is to be used to write the square. Then take a
piece of white cloth, that has been steeped in water of barley and dried. Upon this cloth, with the ink,
write the square. The square is to be written at the first hour of the day, when you can first see. And it is
better to wait in the dark with the things, until such times as you are able to see them clearly, and then
start to write the square. It is as follows:
H B B N N
R H B N R
B R H B N
N B H R B
And when this square is complete, place it between two flat stones, in your room. When it has been there
for two nights more, take it out, and say the names of the people that are to love each other to it, in a loud
voice. Repeat his for three days more. Then the result will be accomplished.
8. To raise storms
A storm comes under the power of the mountain genie, whose name is ARRIDU . So you are to make a
square with his name [13], and write it upon any metal with a pen of red. It is necessary to call he spirit,
to ask him to make the storm. And this is done thus:
Go to a deserted spot. Stand facing the West. Then pick up stones from the place where you are. One
must be from the front, and one from each side. These four stones are then placed in a small cotton bag,
which is hanging from your belt. When you pick them up, say: "YARRIDO." And do not look at
anything you may see, and do not fear anything you may hear.
When you return to your house, bathe from head to foot in water in which a little salt has been put. Then,
when you have dried yourself, take the four stones and place them upon the talisman of the genie, and he
will appear to you.
You can make him come at any time, by placing the stones thus. When he comes, he will speak in a low
voice, as if from the air. Then you will invite him to come down, and to have a small piece of bread that
you have baked for him.
If he comes, he will be like a man covered with much hair, and dressed in the manner of a servant. Then
he will talk of many things, and will tell you that there are secrets known to him. Ask him to tell you a
secret and he will refuse. Then say to him that he must do something for you. And he will agree, but will

## Page 7

The Book of Power (cid:1)
(cid:1)
say: "I cannot tell you anything." Say: "I want to kno(cid:1)w nothing, but you will help me."
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Then tell min that you want a storm to be raised; and (cid:1)tell him the name of the place where the storm is to
(cid:1)
be, and the duration of the storm.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
He will not depart until you have accepted from him (cid:1)a stone which is white and red. This is his sign, and
(cid:1)
if you put it in a ring of copper, he will come when you place it in water. But with the ring he will not
(cid:1)
come in his own shape, and you will be able to see hi(cid:1)m and others not. So, too, you will be able to talk to
(cid:1)
him without speaking, and to see him when he is not there.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Then he will go, and he will start the storm at the tim(cid:1)e you have laid down.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
9. To cause discord between two people
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Discord is an evil thing, and it is to be done only between those who are deserving of it, and it is done in
(cid:1)
this manner: (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
This square is written with an iron point on lead:
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
H D H D H (cid:1)
(cid:1)
I D I D I (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
D H D H D
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
D I D I D
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Take the square, and sew it into a leather cover. This (cid:1)is to hang about your neck. Then say the words
(cid:1)
ROUDMO and PHARRUO seven times to each quarter of the globe, and in a loud voice, when you are
(cid:1)
desirous of creating discord. Then, when you want th(cid:1)at any two people should fight, say their names, and
(cid:1)
then under your breath: "FIGHT, FIGHT, ROUDMO." And they will start to fight.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
And when you want to stop them, say OMDOR , and they will stop. And in this way were many wars
stopped in former times, especially those between the enemies of the faith. And if y(cid:1)ou would stop others
from attacking you, then say the same word yourself, with your eyes fast closed.
10. To speak to whomever you wish, when they are absent
This is one of the most advanced arts, and it needs preparations greater than the general magical things.
(cid:1)(cid:2)
(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:15)(cid:1)(cid:16)(cid:13)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:6)(cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:1)(cid:24)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:26)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:13)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:28)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:30)(cid:1)

The Book of Power
You must fast for seven days, without touching even water, between the hours of dawn and sunset. Then
you are to say the numbers which follow seven times seven times to yourself, with your head in each
direction that is possible. These are the numbers: 1, 9, 2, 5, 4, 9, 6, 5, 3, 3. [14]
Then you are to think of the person that you will talk to, and think hard of everything about him, and then
say all these things about him to yourself, in a loud voice. And if he does not know that you are going to
talk to him, you will have to make the experiment at night, so that he will hear you during sleep.
Then you are to take three vessels of water. One is full, the second is half-full, the third is empty. Take
pebbles to the numbers which I have already given, and these you will drop into first the first vessel, then
into the second, and so on, until all jars have an equal number of pebbles in them. Then say all the
numbers silently into the jars.
Then you will say the message that you have to say, into the jars, once into each, and you will have
another empty one, for the answer.
If you want an answer, then you have to put your ear to the fourth jar, and listen for the answer. And you
will hear it if all has been done aright. Should you hear no answer, you will hear that there is a sound as
of a cricket from the jar, and this is to say that you have made some error, and you are again to try. When
you have done this seven times, you will be able to speak to anyone as easily as if he were present by day
or night, and he will answer you, whether he wishes to or not, and whatever he is doing at the time when
you speak to him. But until you are well practised at this art it is sometimes difficult at the beginning.
And many make the mistake of listening to the jar before they have completed the rites, and this is folly
because it is not possible for the genie of the jars to help when you are listening.
11. To overcome envy
If you know who is your enemy, this is better. Then take a small piece of liver, and tie it up in a scrap cut
from a scroll. Then hang this near the fire, and look at it with anger, as if it were your enemy. Then write
this square on paper and burn it at once:
6 66 848 938
8 11 544 839
1 11 383 839
2 73 774 447
When the man or woman who envies you is troubled by this, he will come and ask you to forgive him.
He will see in a dream that he has made a mistake, and that he must come to you to make amends,


---

## Page 9

The Book of Power (cid:1)
(cid:1)
otherwise he will feel that he will die. And if the man(cid:1) is far away, and cannot come, you will know he
(cid:1)
has repented when the liver takes the shape of a crescent, and then you will remove the spell. This you do
(cid:1)
by making the square again on paper, and placing it i(cid:1)n water, until the writing has disappeared. And
(cid:1)
remember to think that you forgive him.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Envy and dislike can be prevented by taking a coin of silver, and making it square by pounding, and then
(cid:1)
writing the figures upon it, and keeping it in a woolle(cid:1)n cloth, safe from any other person.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
12. To gain the submission of men (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Take a chain, a hook and a piece of wood three finge(cid:1)rs broad. Tie these up with a cord which has no
(cid:1)
knots. Place them in a hole in the ground where they will not be disturbed. Then write this charm on a
(cid:1)
piece of paper: (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Look at this charm by the light of your lamp for one h(cid:1) our each night after it is the half night. Then take
(cid:1)
the charm, and boil it in clear water, until there is nothing left.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Look at your fingers which you must hold before you(cid:1), while you repeat: "77-77-77-77- ANANANAN -
(cid:1)
KAKAKAKAKAK."
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
You will know soon that this is taking effect. And as soon as you feel this, go out into the street, and see
(cid:1)
that the first man to whom you talk will be respectful(cid:1) towards you, even though before he thought you a
(cid:1)
fool. And it is related of mages that many by this means who wee dull at school later became famous,
(cid:1)
and the counsellors of kings. And this is the secret tha(cid:1) t is called the Treasure of Learning. And by it you
(cid:1)
may become respected, no matter what thing you und(cid:1)ertake.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
13. To transmute metals
Base metals cannot be transmuted into gold or silver without the talisman which follows:
1 5 8 A O

This magical square has been used always by the great masters of the alchemistical art, and was to be
found inscribed on all their apparatus, and upon the doors of their houses. "And the more times thou
writest it, the greater will be the power thereof. It is to be written when the Sun is in Leo, or the Moon.
And it is written on any place, or any material, but with a pen with a blade like that of a pointed knife.
When you start your alchemistical experiments, make sure that this talisman is before you , and that its
figures are always in your mind. And when you are starting a part of an experiment, make sure that you
draw it anew. And this is not to be revealed to anyone whatsoever."
To transmute, you may use the way which has been handed down by the philosophers, or you may use
this method:
Take a quantity of lead, and with it half the amount of black powder, and then half again of the red. This
is to be mixed with mercury under the sign of Leo the Lion. And eight days and eight nights the whole is
to be heated in a slow furnace, and it is to be bound with strips of a cloth and enclosed in a vessel of
earthenware, and it is to have this sign upon it: D Z A B.
And when the time is passing, take care that you are pure in mind and body, and in spirit also, for this
will determine the result. And read many times of the book that is prescribed [15]. And when you have
finished these things, and the time is nigh, do not put out the fire, but make sure that it goes out with a
gently decreasing heat, and that it loses its head upon the eighth day. When this is all finished, bring a
witness, for there must be one who sees the gold. And it is sufficient that this witness be an animal or a
man. Open the vessel and take out the gold, and use it as you will. But it is better that the gold be used
before a year old. This is an experiment difficult of success. If anything is neglected, it fails, and if all is
well it prospers, and if there is failure, you must try again and if need be again, until success comes. And
remember that some part of this gold is to be given to the poor, up to two parts in an hundred. [16]
14. To obtain the Elixir of Life
Know first, that none lives for longer than his span, save by the permission of God. And therefore sages
have written that this must be asked of God, before the water of life can be made. Alexander found he
fountain and when he saw it, he was afraid, for the first time in his life, because he knew that there was
much danger and fear therefrom. Therefore, if you are not afraid, prepare yourself with fasting and
meditation for the space of forty days, and then when you are fortified, go out into the desert and seek a
stone which is blue on one side and red on the other. This abounds in the deserts of Africa, and it is
known when it is seen, for there is no other stone like is, and the two colours are separated by a white
line. This is a stone, and it is not a stone; and those with wit will know.

(cid:1)
(cid:1)
When you have found the stone, you must take it to a(cid:1) place far from the world of men, and there you
(cid:1)
must make for it a sheath, which is of copper and gold, and mount it therein, with the figure of a bird
(cid:1)
inscribed on it, and the words LI LI LI NA NA AN . (cid:1)[17]
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Then you place it in water which you have brought from a running stream, and leave it there, alone and
(cid:1)
buried for the time during which seven moons wax an(cid:1) d wane. And then, taking with you new clothes,
(cid:1)
and having bathed and eaten nothing, repair to that place. When you have the stone in your hand, say he
(cid:1)
words again and again, and place it on your heart. Wh(cid:1) en this is finished, put off all your clothes, and
(cid:1)
make a fire from them. Then take up the new garments, and robe yourself. If they are green and white, it
(cid:1)
is better. Then take the water that has been with the s(cid:1)tone, and it is the Water of Life. Half of it is to be
(cid:1)
placed in a small container, and this is to be stoppered and carried with you. The other half is to be drunk,
(cid:1)
when the sun comes up. Then you will live for the pe(cid:1)riod for which you have prayed to be spared.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
But there is a strange thing about this. I have heard it said that every person who takes the water of life
(cid:1)
longs for death, in the end, and that beyond two hund(cid:1)red years he cannot live. So he must take the
(cid:1)
remainder of the water, and drink that, and he will then die at the appointed time.

15. To make camels fight together (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
This secret was much used by commanders in war, who wanted to cause confusion among the armies of
(cid:1)
their enemies. Draw the pictures of two camels on sto(cid:1)nes of different colours, and with inks of different
(cid:1)
colours. Then make a hole through each stone, and join the stones together with pieces of string. Then
(cid:1)
write the numbers of antipathy on one: 2, 3, 9, 4; and(cid:1) on the other, the accursed numbers of infidelity: 3,
(cid:1)
333, 333, and then swing them by the string, so that the genies which are present over those numbers
(cid:1)
shall see and feel them, and the camels will begin to f(cid:1)ight. But if you will cease the fighting, then say the
(cid:1)
numbers of unity and mystery: 1, 5, 7. They shall cease fighting forthwith.

16. To be warm in the cold (cid:1)

Make a talisman of leather, and hang it by means of a leather thong from your righ(cid:1)t arm. On it are to be
inscribed the following signs:
Then, when the moon is full, place the talisman in its rays, and make over it the signs that you have
drawn, with your hand. Close your eyes, and pick up the object This, whenever worn, will keep you

warm in the cold; and formerly soldiers used this, when they were in the desert at nights. And you can
prove it by taking off all your clothes when alone, and putting on the amulet.
17. To become cool in the heat
Take a piece of leather, which must be red, and on it draw these signs: . Then,
when the sun is at its highest, place the talisman in its rays, and make those marks upon it with your
finger, and with your eyes looking at the sun. The talisman is to be kept wrapped in a cloth of gold until
you need it. It is worn under the armpit.
18. To be brave
To be brave, a talisman must be made with these numbers on it:
23 23 23 23
58 85 88 55
25 28 28 25
52 82 82 52
The talisman is made of the tooth of an elephant, and the numbers should be inscribed at the fifth hour of
the day, with a pen made of the horn of a goat which has been slain the day before the new moon.
Then place the talisman in a quantity of warm milk, and let it stand there until the words have
disappeared into the milk . Then take the milk and drink it, saying "S A M T D G K M" in your mind.
After that there will be no more fear in your heart.
19. To gain honour at court
Wear your cap at all times, and inside it is to be embroidered in yellow silk these signs:
A D D 7 D 7 D A D D A
And the success will come to you after seven days. But on each night you must say fifteen times:

## Page 13

The Book of Power (cid:1)
(cid:1)
"YARA YARA ANTARA"; for this is the name and (cid:1)sign of the genie which presides over success and
(cid:1)
honour. And he may appear to you or not. If he is to appear, he will leave beside your bed a brown leaf,
(cid:1)
and you will leave for him a jar of honey, which he w(cid:1)ill take, and place instead a white stone there. And
(cid:1)
when he comes, it will be as an old man, with a large head, and he will give you if you ask it a spear that
(cid:1)
can overcome everything, and which is made from th(cid:1)e iron of the seven mountains. Remember that you
(cid:1)
must not thank him from this, as he will cause it to disappear If you do so.
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
20. To become learned and respected (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Take a piece of polished brass, and upon the surface for three nights of the moon drop a little water, and
(cid:1)
then polish it again. Then retire into a prepared room(cid:1), in which there are to be a book without anything
(cid:1)
written in it, a pot of ink, and a pen made from a reed. Then, when you are ready to summon the genie,
(cid:1)
tap the mirror seven times with the pen. It will seem t(cid:1)hat you are asleep [18]; and you will see him in the
(cid:1)
mirror. He will ask you what you want and whose name you call. Say: "I call DUNA, and I seek
(cid:1)
knowledge." Then he will come nearer, and will answ(cid:1)er to his name. Then ask him what you will, and he
(cid:1)
will write the answer in the book, without touching the pen. Then, if there is any book that you would
(cid:1)
commit to memory, ask him, and the next morning yo(cid:1) u will know it and you will never forget it
(cid:1)
thereafter. Tell him then: "Come DUNA, whenever I(cid:1) shall call with this metal plate, and you are learned,
(cid:1)
and I am but an ignorant student." Then he will agree to come when you call him, and he will give you if
(cid:1)
you ask him a ring which will make you respected as(cid:1) a great sage. If you would that the power of
(cid:1)
learning become more permanent, then eat each day no less than three eggs, and make sure that you eat
(cid:1)
salt before and after each meal. (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
There is one thing that takes away all honour, and tha(cid:1)t is if the person who is respected claims for
(cid:1)
himself any of the credit of having attained his learni(cid:1)ng, for that is an action against the genie who has
given the knowledge. (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
21. To hear music whenever you want it (cid:1)
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
Call the name of the genie EL-ADREL, [19] and when you do, wear on your head a cap of metal. And he
will come, and will speak to you from a pot of water that you have placed on a tabl(cid:1)e near you. Speak to
him fairly, and he will cause you to hear what music you wish. And when you want the music to cease,
call his name the other way about, and he will go away, and take the music. But you must not call him
more than once each day.
22. To be provided with food by spirits
(cid:1)(cid:2)
(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:15)(cid:1)(cid:16)(cid:13)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:6)(cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:1)(cid:24)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:26)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:13)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:28)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:30)(cid:1)

Take a piece of glass the size of your largest finger, and place it above a green stone, and above this a
leaf of a tree which has borne no fruit. Then, with your finger, make in the dust these words: AM MA ES
OM. And when this is done, you must say: "AMESOM [20], come at once; come and bring with thee
that which is needful to me, the food that I want, and the meat, and the fruits and all things that I may eat
a banquet."
Then a genie will come, more than four times the size of a horse, and shaped like a man, black, and with
a smiling face. Speak to him like a friend, and tell him what you will eat. He will ask you to come with
him to his table, but say: "I have reading and writing to do, and cannot stir from here, as I have made a
vow." He will ten disappear and return at once with whatever you have asked him in foods, and lay them
before you.
Then he will seem to go, after speaking nicely to you. But he will not go, though you will not see him.
Then you will ask him if he will share your feast, and he will come again and will sit with you and eat.
And when you want to call him again, he will give you a name that you shall call, and he will come every
time you call.
23. To cure all ills
Take a large piece of black cloth, and place it in a cleft of wood that has been exposed to the sun for
seven years. And to do this some masters formerly used pieces of wood from trees that were more than
seven years of age, and used the wood that was nearest the sun. And it is also good to see the wood from
the side of a house that has stood more than seven years.
Take then this wood and cloth, and place them in a white vessel which is half full of wax of bees. Then
place the whole over a slow fire, leaving it there for two days. Then add a quantity of wheat and boil the
contents of the vessel in water. Place the mass obtained in a white cloth, and leave it to hang until the
moon is full. Then, after a whole moon, take a piece of the wax and place it in molten lead. The lead is
made into a ring, which shall fit upon your first finger. Then, inside the ring, write the words: AL OML
LA, with an iron point.
This ring is the talisman against all disease. When you wish to use it, put a black cloth on your head, and
stand facing the sick man. Let him take your hand with the ring on it, in his hand, and repeat the words.
Then take the ring off your finger, and place it in a little water, and give the water to the man to drink.
Then will he stand up, cured.
24. To become a proficient swordsman

(cid:1)
Take wax of bees, and out of it make small men and animals. They are to be like soldiers and ordinary
(cid:1)
men. Then make a small man like you, but make it la(cid:1)rger, and with a larger sword in his hand. Then
(cid:1)
break the swords of the other men, and say on it all: "AO AO AO APH." From that time you will be
(cid:1)
invincible, by the sword, just as were the heroes of ol(cid:1)d, who used this magic. But you must have with
(cid:1)
you the images at all times.

(cid:1)
appearing in Islamic legend and in the Arabian Night(cid:1)s. The name El-Khadir can be traced back to it's
(cid:1)

languages, in which every letter had a numerical equivalent. Being "1 40 2 1 200 30 1 40 2 1 200 30 1

[8] Where the word Amiyre occurs here, it almost certainly stands for the Arabic word Amir or
Emir&emdash;a prince. There are several varieties of Emirs. Meaning literally ‘Commander’, it is
generally applied to princes in the Arab lands, and was formerly the title of the Caliph: Emir-el-
Momenin, Commander of the Faithful. In this context it probably stands for ‘prince or commander of
Genies’, and not for ‘descendant of the Prophet Mohammed’, as bearers of this title were sometimes
styled in Ottoman Turkey.
[9] This protection square is made from repeating two keywords. A later discord talisman is built on the
same principle, but the second repetition of the words has been corrupted.
[10] In my opinion, this table is made by applying a set of numbers to certain rules, rather than ABJD.
[11] First row of the table. Rendered into characters possibly Akasiz? Using another system Abaviz.
[12] Last row, possibly Ybduh. Using an alternative system Abduh. Both these renderings use an ‘old’
order of the Arabic alphabet.
[13] A square of Arridu may look like this:
A R R I
D U A R
R I D U
A R R I
[14] Rendered into text: Atbhtvhii ?
[15] Possibly the Koran, if the work is of Islamic origin.
[16] Similarly, this may mean the Moslem ‘poor-tax’ of 2½ percent, the Zakat.
[17] There seems to have been a belief in many related traditions that if words of power were written on
parchment and left in water, then drunk the power would pass on it’s affects.
[18] "Asleep" could be a reference to a trance, similar to the techniques of modern use of the magic
