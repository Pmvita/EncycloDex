PENGUIN BOOKS THE COMPLETE DEAD SEA
SCROLLS IN ENGLISH
Geza Vermes was born in Hungary in 1924. He studied in Budapest
and in Louvain, where he read Oriental history and languages and in
1953 obtained a doctorate in theology with a dissertation on the
historical framework of the Dead Sea Scrolls. From 1957 to 1991 he
taught in England at the universities of Newcastle upon Tyne (1957-65)
and Oxford (1965—91). He is now Professor Emeritus of Jewish
Studies and Emeritus Fellow of Wolfson College, but continues to
teach at the Oriental Institute in Oxford. He has edited the Journal of
Jewish Studies since 1971, and since 1991 he has been director of
the Oxford Forum for Qumran Research at the Oxford Centre for
Hebrew and Jewish Studies. Professor Vermes is a Fellow of the
British Academy and of the European Academy of Arts, Sciences and
Humanities. He is the holder of an Oxford D.Litt. and of honorary
doctorates from the universities of Edinburgh, Durham and Sheffield.
His first article on the Dead Sea Scrolls appeared in 1949 and his first
book, Les manuscrits du désert de Juda,in 1953. It was translated
into English in 1956 as Discovery in the Judean Desert. He is also the
author of Scripture and Tradition in Judaism (1961, 1973, 1983);
Jesus the Jew (1973, 1976, 1981, 1983); The Dead Sea Scrolls:
Qumran in Perspective (1977, 1981, 1982, 1994); Jesus and the
World ofJudaism (1983, 1984); The Religion ofJesusthe Jew (1993);
and (with Martin Goodman) The Essenes According to the Classical
Sources (1989); (with Philip Alexander) Discoveries in the Judaean
Desert XXVI (1998) and (also with Philip Alexander) XXXVI (2000);
An Introduction to the Complete Dead Sea Scrolls (1999, 2000); The
Dead Sea Scrolls (The Folio Society, 2000); The Changing Faces of
Jesus (2000); The Authentic Gospel of Jesus (2003) and Jesus in his
Jewish Context (2003). He played a leading part in the rewriting of
Emil Schiirer’s classic work The History of the Jewish People in the
Age of Jesus Christ (1973-87). His autobiography, Providential

Preface
In the spring of 1947 a young Arab shepherd climbed into a cave in the
Judaean desert and stumbled on the first Dead Sea Scrolls. For those
of us who lived through the Qumran story from the beginning, the
realization that all this happened half a century ago brings with it a
melancholy feeling. The Scrolls are no longer a recent discovery as we
used to refer to them, but over the years they have grown in
significance and now the golden jubilee of the first manuscript find calls
for celebration with joy and satisfaction. Following the ‘revolution’
which ‘liberated’ all the manuscripts in 1991 - until that moment a large
portion of them was kept away from the public gaze - every interested
person gained free access to the entire Qumran library. I eagerly
seized the chance and set out to explore the whole collection. Today,
after four and a half years of intense study, I feel confident that I can
present the complete canvas of the Dead Sea Scrolls and disclose to
the many interested readers the message of these ancient
manuscripts about ancient Judaism and to a more limited extent about
early Christianity.
In its successive editions this book has endeavoured to serve a dual
audience of scholars and educated lay people. Over the years it has
grown in size - it contained only 255 pages in 1962 - and I trust also in
its grasp of the subject. While this translation of the non-biblical Scrolls
does not claim to cover every fragment retrieved from the caves, it is
complete in one sense: it offers in a readable form all the texts
sufficiently well preserved to be understandable in English. In plain
words, meaningless scraps or badly damaged manuscript sections
are not inflicted on the reader. Those who wish to survey texts
consisting only of broken lines, or of single letters and half-letters,
should turn to the official series Discoveries in the Judaean Desert, in
which every surviving detail is put on record.
In addition to the English rendering of the Hebrew and Aramaic texts
found in the eleven Qumran caves, two inscribed potsherds (ostraca)

retrieved from the Qumran site and two Qumran-type documents
discovered in the fortress of Masada, and brief introductory notes to
each text, this volume also provides an up-to-date general introduction,
outlining the history of fifty years of Scroll research and sketching the
organization, history and religious message of the Qumran
Community. A Scroll catalogue, an essential bibliography and an index
of Qumran texts are appended to facilitate further study and research.

Map 2: The Caves of Qumran
Has the greatly increased source material substantially altered our
perception of the writings found at Qumran? I do not think so. Nuances
and emphases have changed, but additional information has mainly
helped to fill in gaps and clarify obscurities; it has not undermined our
earlier conceptions regarding the Community and its ideas. We had
the exceptionally good fortune that all but one of the major non-biblical
Scrolls were published at the start, between 1950 and 1956: the
Habakkuk Commentary (1950), the Community Rule (1951), the War
Scroll and the Thanksgiving Hymns (1954/5) and the best-preserved
columns of the Genesis Apocryphon (1956). Even the Temple Scroll,
which had remained concealed until 1967 in a Bata shoebox by an
antique dealer, was edited ten years later. The large Scrolls have
served as foundation and pillars, and the thousands of fragments as
building stones, with which the unique shrine of Jewish religion and
culture that is Qumran is progressively restored to its ancient
splendour.
Finally, it is a most pleasant duty to express my warmest thanks to
friends and colleagues who helped to make this book less imperfect
than it might otherwise have been. First and foremost, I wish publicly to
convey my gratitude to Professor Emanuel Tov, editor-in-chief of the
Dead Sea Scrolls Publication Project, for his generosity in answering
queries and assisting in every possible way. My very special thanks
are due also to Professor Joseph M. Baumgarten, who allowed me to
consult his edition of the Damascus Document fragments from Cave 4
prior to their publication in DJD, and to my former pupil, Dr Jonathan
G. Campbell, who did not shirk the onerous task of reading through
and commenting on the rather bulky printout of this volume.

Preface to the Penguin Classics edition
Since the end of 1996, when the text of The Complete Dead Sea
Scrolls in English was sent to the printers, eighteen further tomes of
manuscript material have appeared in the series Discoveries in the
Judaean Desert (DJD).Today, in January 2003, only three more
volumes, two biblical and one non-biblical, still await publication before
the 39-volume venture, begun in 1955 with DJD I, reaches its fulfilment.
When reviewing The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in 1997, John J.
Collins wittily predicted: ‘It is not inconceivable that a more complete
edition may appear a few years hence.’ Yet even today’s revised and
updated version remains in some way incomplete. It is without the
scriptural texts found in the caves, which I never intended to include.
Luckily these are now available in The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible issued
by Martin Abegg, Peter Flint and Eugene Ulrich (Harper San
Francisco, 1999). Neither have I attempted at any stage to present the
English translation of every scrap devoid of significance (small,
unconnected manuscript remains, broken sentences, single words,
half-words or letters). However, I can state even more confidently than I
did seven years ago that the reader will find in this volume all that is
meaningful and interesting in the non-biblical Dead Sea Scrolls.
The introductory chapters and the bibliographies have also been
brought up to date so that account is taken in them of all fresh material
as well as of the continuous advance of Qumran research.
The publishers have decided to provide this book with a new niche:
forty-one years after its first appearance in 1962 in the Pelican series,
it will have its home from now on next to the great works of world
literature in the Penguin Classics library.
I feel deeply honoured.
Oxford, January 2003

I. Introduction
On the western shore of the Dead Sea, about eight miles south of
Jericho, lies a complex of ruins known as Khirbet Qumran. It occupies
one of the lowest parts of the earth, on the fringe of the hot and arid
wastes of the Wilderness of Judaea, and is today, apart from
occasional invasions by coachloads of tourists, lifeless, silent and
empty. But from that place, members of an ancient Jewish religious
community, whose centre it was, hurried out one day and in secrecy
climbed the nearby cliffs in order to hide away in eleven caves their
precious scrolls. No one came back to retrieve them, and there they
remained undisturbed for almost 2,000 years.
The account of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, as the
manuscripts are inaccurately designated, and of the half a century of
intense research that followed, is in itself a fascinating as well as an
exasperating story. It has been told many a time, but this fiftieth
anniversary of the first Scroll find excuses, and even demands, yet
another rehearsal.1
A BIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF FIFTY YEARS OF DEAD
SEA SCROLLS RESEARCH
1. 1947-1967
News of an extraordinary discovery of seven ancient Hebrew and
Aramaic manuscripts began to spread in 1948 from Israeli and
American sources.2 The original chance find by a young Bedouin
shepherd, Muhammad edh-Dhib, occurred during the last months of
the British mandate in Palestine in the spring or summer of 1947,
unless it was slightly earlier, in the winter of 1946.3 In 1949, the cave

## Page 26

where the scrolls lay hidden was identified, thanks to the efforts of a
bored Belgian army officer of the United Nations Armistice Observer
Corps, Captain Philippe Lippens, assisted by a unit of Jordan’s Arab
Legion, commanded by Major-General Lash. It was investigated by G.
Lankester Harding, the English Director of the Department of
Antiquities of Jordan, and the French Dominican archaeologist and
biblical scholar, Father Roland de Vaux. They retrieved hundreds of
leather fragments, some large but most of them minute, in addition to
the seven scrolls found in the same cave.
Three of the rolls, an incomplete Isaiah manuscript, a scroll of Hymns
and one describing the War of the Sons of Light against the Sons of
Darkness, were purchased in 1947 by the Hebrew University’s
Professor of Jewish Archaeology, E. L. Sukenik, who proceeded at full
speed towards their publication. The other four were entrusted for
study and eventual publication by their owner, the Arab metropolitan
archbishop Mar Athanasius, head of the Syrian Orthodox monastery of
St Mark in Jerusalem, to the resident staff of the American School for
Oriental Research in Jerusalem, Millar Burrows, W H. Brownlee and J.
C. Trever. These three took charge of a complete Isaiah manuscript,
the Commentary on Habakkuk and the Manual of Discipline, later
renamed the Community Rule. Finally, after the splitting of British
mandatary Palestine into Israel and Jordan, at the École Biblique et
Archéologique Française in Jordanian Jerusalem two young
researchers, the Frenchman Dominique Barthélemy and the Pole
Józef Tadeusz Milik, were commissioned by de Vaux and Harding in
late 1951 to edit the fragments collected in Cave I.
Between 1951 and 1956, ten further caves were discovered, most
of them by Bedouin in the first instance. Two yielded substantial
quantities of material. Thousands and thousands of fragments were
found in Cave 4 and several scrolls, including the longest, the Temple
Scroll, were retrieved from Cave II. The previously neglected ruins of a
settlement in the proximity of the caves were also excavated by
Harding and de Vaux, and the view soon prevailed that the texts, the
caves and the Qumran site were interconnected, and that consequently
the study of the script and contents of the manuscripts should be
accompanied by archaeological research.

Progress was surprisingly quick despite the fact that in those
halcyon days, apart from the small Nash papyrus, containing the Ten
Commandments, found in Egypt and now in the Cambridge University
Library, no Hebrew documents dating to Late Antiquity were extant to
provide terms of comparison. In 1948 and 1949, Sukenik published in
Hebrew two preliminary surveys entitled Hidden Scrolls from the
JudaeanDesert, and concluded that the religious community involved
was the ascetic sect of the Essenes, well known from the first-century
CE writings of Philo, Josephus and Pliny the Elder, a thesis worked
out in great detail from 1951 onwards by André Dupont-Sommer in
Paris.4 The first Qumran scrolls to reach the public, and the
archaeological setting in which they were discovered, echoed three
striking Essene characteristics. The Community Rule, a basic code of
sectarian existence, reflects Essene common ownership and celibate
life, while the geographical location of Qumran tallies with Pliny’s
Essene settlement on the north-western shore of the Dead Sea, south
of Jericho. The principal novelty provided by the manuscripts consists
of cryptic allusions to the historical origins of the Community, launched
by a priest called the Teacher of Righteousness, who was persecuted
by a Jewish ruler, designated as the Wicked Priest. The Teacher and
his followers were compelled to withdraw into the desert, where they
awaited the impending manifestation of God’s triumph over evil and
darkness in the end of days, which had already begun.
An almost unanimous agreement soon emerged, dating the
discovery, on the basis of palaeography and archaeology, to the last
centuries of the Second Temple, i.e. second century BCE to first
century CE. For a short while there was controversy between de Vaux,
who decreed that the pottery and all the finds belonged to the
Hellenistic era (i.e. pre-63 BCE), and Dupont-Sommer, who argued for
an early Roman (post-63) date. But the finding of further caves and the
excavation of the ruins of Qumran brought about, on 4 April 1952, de
Vaux’s dramatic retraction before the French Académie des
Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. His revised archaeological synthesis,
presented in the 1959 Schweich Lectures of the British Academy,
while admittedly incomplete, is still the best comprehensive statement
available today.5

## Page 28

A third point of early consensus concerns the chronology of the
events alluded to in the Qumran writings, especially the biblical
commentaries published in the 1950S and the Damascus Document.
The so-called Maccabaean theory, placing the conflict between the
Teacher of Righteousness and the politico-religious Jewish leadership
of the day in the time of the Maccabaean high priest or high priests
Jonathan and/or Simon, was first formulated in my 1952 doctoral
dissertation, published in 1953,6 and was soon to be adopted with
variations in detail by such leading specialists as J. T. Milik, F. M.
Cross and R. de Vaux.7
As long as the editorial task consisted only of publishing the seven
scrolls from Cave I, work was advancing remarkably fast. Millar
Burrows and his colleagues published their three manuscripts in 1950
and 1951.8 Sukenik’s three texts appeared in a posthumous volume in
1954-5.9 In the interest of speed, these editors generously abstained
from translating and interpreting the texts, and were content with
releasing the photographs and their transcription. The best-preserved
sections of the Aramaic Genesis Apocryphon followed closely in
1956.10 Even the fragments from Cave I, handled with alacrity and
loving care by D. Barthélemy and J. T Milik, appeared in 1955.11 The
secrecy rule of later years, restricting access to unpublished texts to a
small team of editors appointed by de Vaux, had not yet been applied.
On my first visit to Jerusalem in 1952, I was allowed to examine the
fragments of the Rule of the Congregation (1QSa), as may be seen
from the inclusion in the final edition of a reading suggested by me to
the editors.
The scroll fragments, partly found by the archaeologists, but mostly
purchased from the Arabs, who nine times out of ten outwitted their
professional rivals, were cleaned, sorted out and displayed in the so-
called Scrollery in the Rockefeller Museum, later renamed the
Palestine Archaeological Museum, to become after 1967 once more
the Rockefeller Museum. If the mass of material disgorged by Cave 4
had not upset the original arrangements, the scandalous delays in
publishing in later years need never have happened.
To deal with Cave 4, Father de Vaux improvised, in 1953 and 1954,


---

## Page 29

a team of seven on the whole young and untried scholars. Barthélemy
opted out, and the brilliant but unpredictable Abbé J. T. Milik, who later
left the Roman Catholic priesthood, became the pillar of the new
group. He was joined by the French Abbé Jean Starcky, and two
Americans, Monsignor Patrick Skehan and Frank Moore Cross. John
Marco Allegro and John Strugnell were recruited from Britain, and from
Germany, Claus-Hunno Hunzinger, who soon resigned and was
replaced later by the French Abbé Maurice Baillet.
It should have been evident to anyone with a modicum of good
sense that a group of seven editors, of whom only two, Starcky and
Skehan, had already established a scholarly reputation, was
insufficient to perform such an enormous task on any level, let alone to
produce the kind of ‘last word’ edition de Vaux appears to have
contemplated. The second serious error committed by de Vaux was
that he wholly relied on his personal, quasi-patriarchal authority,
instead of setting up from the start a supervisory body empowered, if
necessary, to sack those members of the team who might fail to fulfil
their obligations promptly and to everyone’s satisfaction.
Yet before depicting the chaos characterizing the publishing
process in the 1970s and 1980s, in fairness it should be stressed that,
during the first decade or so, the industry of the group could not
seriously be faulted. Judging from the completion around 1060 of a
primitive Concordance, recorded on handwritten index cards, of all the
words appearing in the fragments found in Caves 2 to 10, it is clear
that at an early date most of the texts had been identified and
deciphered. The many criticisms advanced in subsequent years,
focusing on these scholars’ refusal to put their valuable findings into
the public domain, should not prevent one from acknowledging that this
original achievement, in which J. T. Milik had the lion’s share, deserves
unrestricted admiration.
After the publication of the Cave I fragments in 1955, the contents of
the eight minor caves (2-3, 5-10) were released in a single volume in
1963.12 In 1965 J. A. Sanders, an American scholar who was not part
of the original team, edited the Psalms Scroll, found in Cave II in
1956.13 Finally, with its typescript completed and dispatched to the
printers a year before the fatal date of 1967, the first poorly edited

volume of Cave 4 fragments saw the light of day in 1968.14
2. 1967-1990
With the occupation of East Jerusalem in the Six Day War, all the scroll
fragments housed in the Palestine Archaeological Museum came
under the control of the Israel Department of Antiquities. Only the
Copper Scroll and a few other fragments exhibited in Amman
remained in Jordanian hands. The Temple Scroll, which until then had
been held by a dealer in Bethlehem,15 was quickly retrieved with the
help of army intelligence and acquired by the State of Israel. Yigael
Yadin, deputy prime minister of Israel in the 1970s, mixing politics with
scholarship, managed to complete a magisterial three-volume
publication by 1977.16
A gentlemanly gesture on the part of the Israelis, who decided not to
interfere with de Vaux, left him and his scattered troop in charge of the
Cave 4 texts.17 As for the unpublished manuscripts from Cave II, they
were handled by Dutch and American academics.18
Father de Vaux, whose anti-Israeli sentiments were no secret,
quietly withdrew to his tent and remained inactive until his death in
1971. Another French Dominican, Pierre Benoit, succeeded him as it
were by natural selection in the editorial chair in 1972. The Israeli
archaeological establishment, still aloof, conferred its blessing on him.
By then, at my instigation, C. H. Roberts, Secretary to the Delegates,
i.e. chief executive of Oxford University Press, decided to demand
speedier publication, but Benoit’s ineffectual rallying call either elicited
no response from his men, or produced promises which were never
honoured.19 In a lecture delivered in 1977, I coined the phrase which
was thereafter often repeated that the greatest Hebrew manuscript
discovery was fast becoming ‘the academic scandal par excellence of
the twentieth century’.20
One may ask how and why, after such an apparently propitious
beginning, a group of scholars, most of whom were gifted, had turned
the editorial work on the Scrolls into such a lamentable story? In my


---

## Page 31

opinion, the ‘academic scandal of the century’ resulted from a
concatenation of causes. Lack of organization and unfortunate choice
of collaborators can be blamed on de Vaux. For the majority of the
team members who had other jobs to cope with, the overlong part-time
effort caused their original enthusiasm to fade and vanish. J. T. Milik,
the most productive of them until the mid-seventies, appears to have
been disenchanted by the cool reception of his highly speculative
thesis contained in his edition of The Books ofEnoch:Aramaic
Fragments of Qumran Cave 4(1976). ‘Academic imperialism’ was
also a factor. It was easier to hold that ‘These texts belong to us, not to
you!’ than to admit that the procrastinating editors had undertaken
more than they could deliver. Add to this the initial unwillingness of the
Israelis to shoulder their responsibilities, and, as will be shown, their
lack of foresight and repeated misjudgements before, finally, in the late
1980s, they began to take an active part in matters of editorial policy.
Need I say more?
The inevitable began to happen: in 1980 Patrick Skehan died,
followed by Jean Starcky in 1986, both without publishing their
assignments. Eugene Ulrich and Emile Puech became their heirs,
while F. M. Cross and J. Strugnell distributed portions of their texts to
serve as dissertation topics for doctoral students at Harvard University.
Though responsible for some good, and occasionally excellent,
monographs, this unfortunate practice further delayed progress as
thesis writers like to keep their cards close to their chests until their
PhDs are in the bag.
In 1986, a year before his death, Pierre Benoit resigned as editor-
in-chief and the depleted international team elected as his successor
the talented but tardy John Strugnell, who in thirty-three years failed to
produce a single volume of text. In 1987, at a public session of a
Scrolls Symposium held in London, I urged him to publish at once the
photographic plates, while he and his acolytes carried on with their
work at their customary snail pace. This request was met with a one-
syllable negative answer. To the surprise of many, the Israel Antiquities
Authority (or IAA) acquiesced in Strugnell’s appointment. His
grandiose schemes never bore fruit. In 1990, after a compromising
interview given by him to an Israeli newspaper, in which he was


---

## Page 32

reported as having made disparaging remarks not only about Israelis,
but also about the Jewish religion - he called it horrible - his fellow
editors persuaded him to tender his resignation. It was accepted by
the IAA on health grounds. Belatedly even the Israelis saw the light,
and de facto terminated the thirty-seven-year-old and ultimately
disastrous reign of the international team.
3. 1990-2003
After John Strugnell’s withdrawal, the very capable Emanuel Tov,
Professor of Biblical Studies at the Hebrew University, was appointed
chief editor, the first Jew and the first Israeli to head the Qumran
publication project. He began his activities auspiciously by
redistributing the unpublished texts among freshly recruited
collaborators. The new editorial team, of which I became a member in
1991, consists of some sixty scholars compared to the original seven!
Unfortunately, Tov did not feel free to cancel the ‘secrecy rule’,
introduced and strictly enforced by de Vaux and his successors,
prohibiting access to unpublished texts to all but a few chosen editors.
However, the protective dam erected around the fragments by the
international team collapsed in the autumn of 1991 under the growing
pressure of public opinion, mobilized in particular by Hershel Shanks,
in the columns of the widely read Biblical Archaeology Review (BAR).
The first landmark event leading towards full freedom was the
publication in early September by BAR’s parent body, the Biblical
Archaeology Society, of seventeen Cave 4 manuscripts reconstructed
with the help of a computer by Ben Zion Wacholder and Martin
Abegg21 from the Preliminary Concordance, alluded to earlier, which
was privately issued in twenty-five copies (in theory only for the use of
the official editors) by John Strugnell in 1988.22 Later in the same
month out of the blue came the announcement by William A. Moffett
that the Huntington Library of San Marino, California, a renowned
research institution, would bring to an end the forty-year-old closed
shop by opening its complete photographic archive of the Qumran


---

## Page 33

Scrolls to all qualified scholars.23
The IAA and the official editors attempted to resist but, by the end of
October, under pressure from the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, they
were all forced to recognize that the battle was lost and all restrictions
had to be lifted. Almost at once, the Scroll photograph archives at the
Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies and at the Ancient
Biblical Manuscript Center at Claremont, previously legally compelled
to restrict access only to persons approved by Jerusalem, were also
thrown open to all competent research scholars. Moreover, in
November 1991 the Biblical Archaeology Society published a two-
volume photographic edition of the bulk of the Qumran fragments
compiled by Robert Eisenman and James Robinson.24 How the two
Californian professors obtained the material remains unclear. This
new policy has had an essentially beneficial effect on Qumran studies.
Since vested interests are no longer protected, the rate of publication
has noticeably accelerated and from 1992 learned periodicals have
been flooded with short or not so short papers by scholars claiming
fresh insights. Free competition has expedited the official edition itself.
The first Cave 4 volume of biblical texts, announced as imminent by
Father Benoit in 1983, actually appeared -pace the 1992 date on the
cover page—on 4 March 1993.25 Scholarship and the general public
were to become the beneficiaries of the new era of liberty. Only the
procrastinators and the selfish stood to lose. By 1996, thanks to the
highly efficient stewardship of the editor-in-chief, Emanuel Tov, four
further volumes have been published and another four are in the
pipeline. Compared with the output of the previous regime, this is an
admirable change indeed. At the time of the revision of this book,
thirty-six out of the thirty-nine volumes of Discoveries in the
JudaeanDesert (DJD) have appeared, twenty-eight of them since the
watershed year of the Scrolls ‘revolution’ in 1991.
THE PRESENT STATE OF DEAD SEA SCROLLS
STUDIES


---

## Page 34

Between 1947 and 1956, the eleven Qumran caves yielded a dozen
scrolls written on leather and one embossed on copper. To these we
have to add fragments on papyrus or leather, the precise number of
which is unknown but probably in the order of six figures. About 800
original documents are fully or partly represented. The Cave 4 list
alone contains 575titles,26 though it seems that some twenty
documents (4Q342-61) probably originating from non-Qumran
Judaean desert locations were mistakenly catalogued as 4Q material.
Most scrolls are written in Hebrew, a smaller portion in Aramaic and
only a few attest the ancient Greek or Septuagint version of the
Bible.27
Among the texts previously known, all the books of the Hebrew
Scriptures are extant at least in fragments save Esther, the absence of
which may be purely accidental.28 Even Daniel, the most recent work
to enter the Palestinian canon in the mid-second century BCE, is
attested to by eight manuscripts.29 There are also remains of Aramaic
and Greek scriptural translations.
Furthermore, the caves have yielded some of the Apocrypha, i.e.
religious works missing from the Hebrew Scriptures but included in the
Septuagint, the Bible of Greek-speaking Jews. Caves 4 and 11
revealed the Book of Tobit in Aramaic and in Hebrew, Psalm cli,
described in the Greek version as a ‘supernumerary’ psalm, and the
Wisdom of Jesus ben Sira or Ecclesiasticus in Hebrew. Part of the
latter, chapters xxxixxliv, has also survived at Masada, and hence
cannot be later than 73/4 CE, the date when the stronghold was
captured by the Romans, and two medieval manuscripts, discovered
in the storeroom (genizah) of a synagogue in Cairo in 1896, have
preserved about two thirds of the Greek version.
A third category of religious books, the Pseudepigrapha, though
very popular in some Jewish circles, failed to attain canonical rank
either in Palestine or in the Diaspora. Some of them, previously known
in Greek, Latin or Syriac translations, have turned up in their original
Hebrew (e.g. the Book of Jubilees) or Aramaic (e.g. the Book of
Enoch). A good many further compositions pertaining to this class
have also come to light, such as fictional accounts relating among
others to Joseph, Amram, Moses, Joshua or Jeremiah, as well as


---

## Page 35

apocryphal psalms, five of which have survived also in Syriac
translation, others being revealed for the first time at Qumran.
The sectarian Dead Sea Scrolls, thought to have been composed or
revised by the Qumran Community, constitute, with one exception,30 a
complete novelty. This literature comprises rule books, Bible
interpretation of various kinds, religious poetry, Wisdom compositions
in prose and in verse, sectarian calendars and liturgical texts, one of
them purporting to echo the angelic worship in the heavenly temple. To
these are to be added several ‘horoscopes’ or, more precisely,
documents of astrological physiognomy, a literary genre based on the
belief that the temper, physical features and fate of an individual
depend on the configuration of the heavens at the time of the person’s
birth, and a text (brontologion) predicting prodigies if thunder is heard
on certain days, with the moon passing through given signs of the
Zodiac. Finally, the Copper Scroll alludes in cryptic language to sixty-
four caches of precious metals and scrolls, including another copy of
this same inventory written without riddles.
After a first few gaffes committed before the excavation of the site,
the palaeographical, archaeological and literary-historical study of the
evidence produced a general consensus among scholars concerning
(a) the age, (b) the provenance and (c) the significance of the
discoveries. Holders of fringe opinions have recently tended to explain
this consensus as tyrannically imposed from above by Roland de Vaux
and his henchmen. The truth, however, is that the opinio communis
has resulted from a natural evolutionary process - from arguments
which others found persuasive even when advanced by single
individuals often unconnected with the international team - and not from
an almighty establishment forcing an official view down the throats of
weaklings.
(a) The Dating of the Manuscripts
Palaeography was the first method employed to establish the age of
the texts. Despite the paucity of comparative material, experts


---

## Page 36

independently arrived at dates ranging between the second century
BCE and the first century CE. By the 1960s, in addition to the Qumran
texts, they could make use also of manuscripts from Masada (first
century CE), as well as from the Murabba‘at and other Judaean desert
caves yielding first- and second-century CE Jewish writings. A rather
too rigid, but useful, comprehensive system was quickly devised by F.
M. Cross.31 While admittedly controversial if unsupported either by
actual dates in the manuscripts themselves (a phenomenon, alas,
unknown at Qumran) or by external criteria, these palaeographical
conclusions were to receive a twofold boost from archaeology and
radiocarbon dating. The archaeological thesis, based inter alia on the
study of pottery and coins, was formulated by R. de Vaux (cf. note 5 on
p. 4). He assigned the occupation of Qumran to the period between
the second half of the second century BCE and the first war between
Jews and Romans (66-70 CE).
Radiocarbon tests were first applied to the cloth wrapping of one of
the scrolls as early as 1951. The date suggested was 33 CE, but one
had to reckon with a 10 per cent margin of error each way.32 However,
with the improved techniques of the 1990s, eight Qumran manuscripts
were subjected to Accelerator Mass Spectrometry or AM S. Six of
them were found to be definitely pre-Christian, and only two straddled
over the first century BCE/first century CE dividing line.33 Most
importantly, with a single exception - the Testament of Qahat being
shown to be about 300 years earlier than expected - the radiocarbon
dates confirm in substance those proposed by the palaeographers.
Unfortunately, the manuscripts tested in 1990 did not include
historically sensitive texts. But in 1994 the IAA invited the Arizona AMS
Laboratory at the University of Arizona, Tucson to analyse eighteen
texts and two linen fragments. Thirteen of the manuscripts came
definitely from Qumran and one of these had already been carbon-
dated in Zurich. Three texts were ‘date-bearing’. The general
conclusion is as follows: ‘Measurements on samples of known ages
are in good agreement with those known ages. Ages determined from
14C measurements on the remainder of the Dead Sea Scroll samples
are in reasonable agreement with paleographic estimates of such


---

## Page 37

ages, in the case where those estimates are available.’34 On the
whole, the results of this second radiocarbon analysis are somewhat
disappointing in that, while the dates arrived at accommodate the
palaeographic proposals, the margin of error is considerably greater
than that appearing in the 1990 Zurich tests. Nevertheless, Arizona has
scored on one highly significant point: the Habakkuk Commentary,
chief source of the history of the Qumran sect, is definitely put in the
pre-Christian era between 120 and 5 BCE. In consequence, fringe
scholars who see in this writing allusions to events described in the
New Testament will find they have a problem on their hands. In sum,
the general scholarly view today places the Qumran Scrolls roughly
between 200 BCE and 70 CE, with a small portion of the texts
possibly stretching back to the third century BCE, and the bulk of the
extant material dating to the first century BCE, i.e. late Hasmonaean or
early Herodian in the jargon of the palaeographers.
(b) The Provenance of the Manuscripts
With negligible exceptions, scholarly opinion recognized already in the
1950s that the Scrolls found in the caves and the nearby ruined
settlement were related. To take the obvious example, Cave 4 with its
575 (or perhaps 555) documents lies literally within a stone’s throw
from the buildings. At the same time, the Essene identity of the ancient
inhabitants of Qumran gained general acceptance. Today the Essene
theory is questioned by some, but usually for unsound reasons. They
adopt a simplistic attitude in comparing the two sets of evidence,
namely the classical sources (Philo, Josephus and Pliny the Elder) and
Qumran, and any disagreement or contradiction between them is
hailed as final proof against the Essene thesis. Yet, if its intricacies are
handled with sophistication, it is still the best hypothesis today.35
Indeed, it accounts best for such striking peculiarities as common
ownership of property and the lack of reference to women in the
Community Rule, the probable coexistence of celibate and married
sectaries (in accordance with Flavius Josephus’ account of two kinds


---

## Page 38

of Essenes), and the remarkable coincidence between the
geographical setting of Qumran and Pliny the Elder’s description of an
Essene establishment near the Dead Sea between Jericho and
Engedi. I admit of course that the Scrolls and the archaeological data
surrounding them do not always fully agree with the Greek and Latin
notices, and that both the Qumran and the classical accounts need to
be interpreted and adjusted, bearing in mind that the Scrolls represent
the views of initiates against those of more or less complete
outsiders.36 But since none of the competing theories associating the
Qumran group with Pharisees, Sadducees, Zealots, or Jewish-
Christians can withstand critical scrutiny, I remain unrepentant in
upholding my statement formulated in 1977 as still valid today: ‘The
final verdict must ... be that of the proposed solutions the Essene
theory is relatively the soundest. It is even safe to say that it possesses
a high degree of intrinsic probability.’37
(c) The Significance of the Qumran Scrolls
The uniqueness of the Qumran discovery was due to the fact that with
the possible exception of the Nash papyrus referred to earlier (p. 3), no
Jewish text in Hebrew or Aramaic written on perishable material could
previously be traced to the pre-Christian period. Before 1947, the
oldest Hebrew text of the whole of Isaiah was the Ben Asher codex
from Cairo dated to 895 CE, as against the complete Isaiah Scroll
from Cave I, which is about a millennium older. The Apocrypha and
Pseudepigrapha, save the Hebrew Ben Sira and the Aramaic
fragments of the Testament of Levi from the Cairo Genizah, had
survived only in translation. The sectarian writings found in the caves,
apart from the already mentioned Damascus Document (p. II), count as
a total novelty.
To begin with, the Qumran Scrolls and the other Judaean Desert
finds have created a new discipline: ancient, i.e. pre-medieval,
Hebrew codicology. We now possess concrete evidence that scribes
carefully prepared the leather or papyrus on which they were to write,


---

## Page 39

often ruling them, with vegetable ink, kept in ink-wells. Paragraphs and
larger unit openings were indicated by symbols in the margins. Longer
compositions were written on scrolls, on one side of the sheets only,
some of them numbered, which were subsequently sewn together.
Papyrus documents were often reused, with a different text inscribed
on the verso. Short works such as letters were recorded on small
pieces of writing material: leather, papyrus, wood or potsherd. By
contrast, no book or codex, with pages covered with script on both
sides and bound together, has come to light at Qumran, or in any other
Judaean Desert site.
The Qumran finds have also substantially altered our views
concerning the text and canon of the Bible. The many medieval
Hebrew scriptural manuscripts, representing the traditional or
Masoretic text, are remarkable for their almost general uniformity.
Compared to the often meaningful divergences between the traditional
Hebrew text and its ancient Greek, Latin or Syriac translations, the few
variant readings of the Masoretic Bible manuscripts, ignoring obvious
scribal errors, mainly concern spelling. By contrast, the Qumran
scriptural scrolls, and especially the fragments, are characterized by
extreme fluidity: they often differ not just from the customary wording
but also, when the same book is attested by several manuscripts,
among themselves. In fact, some of the fragments echo what later
became the Masoretic text; others resemble the Hebrew underlying the
Greek Septuagint; yet others recall the Samaritan Torah or
Pentateuch, the only part of the Bible which the Jews of Samaria
accepted as Scripture. Some Qumran fragments represent a mixture
of these, or something altogether different. It should be noted, however,
that none of these variations affects the scriptural message itself. In
short, while largely echoing the contents of biblical books, Qumran has
opened an entirely new era in the textual history of the Hebrew
Scriptures.38
The Community’s attitude to the biblical canon, i.e. the list of books
considered as Holy Writ, is less easy to define, as no such list of titles
has survived. Canonical status may be presumed indirectly either from
authoritative quotations or from theological commentary. As regards
the latter, the caves have yielded various interpretative works on the


---

## Page 40

Pentateuch (the Temple Scroll, reworked Pentateuch manuscripts, the
Genesis Apocryphon and other commentaries on Genesis) and the
Prophets (e.g. Isaiah, Habakkuk, Nahum, etc.), but only on the Psalms
among the Writings, the third traditional division of the Jewish Bible.
From the texts available in 1988, I collected over fifty examples of
Bible citations which were used as proof in doctrinal expositions, thus
indicating that they were thought to possess special religious or
doctrinal importance.39
On the other hand, the Psalms Scroll from Cave 11 contains seven
apocryphal poems, including chapter L1 of the Wisdom of Jesus ben
Sira, not annexed to, but interspersed among, the canonical hymns.
This may be explained as a liturgical phenomenon, a collection of
songs chanted during worship; but it may, and in my view probably
does, mean that at Qumran the concept ‘Bible’ was still hazy, and the
‘canon’ open-ended, which would account for the remarkable freedom
in the treatment of the text of Scripture by a community whose life was
nevertheless wholly centred on the Bible.
There are two Apocrypha attested at Qumran. In connection with
Tobit one can note that four out of the five Cave 4 manuscripts are in
Aramaic and only one in Hebrew, but they all reflect the longer version
of the Greek Tobit. So the long-debated original language of this book
is still uncertain, but Aramaic has become the likeliest candidate. On
the other hand, the Hebrew poem from Ben Sira L1 has a patently
better chance of reflecting the original than either the Greek translation
by the author’s grandson, preserved in the Septuagint, or the Hebrew
of the medieval Cairo Genizah manuscripts, because the Qumran
version alone faithfully reflects the acrostic character of the
composition with the lines starting with the successive letters of the
Hebrew alphabet, aleph, bet, gimel, etc.
Qumran has also added to the Pseudepigrapha several new works
dealing with biblical figures such as Joseph, Qahat, Amram, Moses,
Joshua, Samuel. Among the works in this category which were
previously known, the Aramaic fragments of Enoch deserve special
mention because they appear to attest only four out of the five books of
the Ethiopic Enoch.40 Book 2 (i.e. chapters XXXVII-LXXII), which
describes the heavenly apocalyptic figure called son of man, a subject


---

## Page 41

on which New Testament scholars have wasted a considerable
amount of ink without approaching even the vaguest consensus, is
missing at Qumran. Thus the Aramaic Enoch does not support their
speculations any more than do the Greek manuscripts, which are also
without chapters XXXVII-LXXII of the Ethiopic Enoch.41
The contribution of the Scrolls to general Jewish history is negligible,
and even to the history of the Community is fairly limited. The chief
reason for this is that none of the non-biblical compositions found at
Qumran belongs to the historical genre. The sectarian persons and
events mentioned in the manuscripts are depicted in cryptic language
as fulfilment of ancient prophecies relating to the last age. The chief
sources of sectarian history, the Damascus Document and the Bible
commentaries or pesharim, identify the Community’s principal
enemies as the kings of Yavan (Greece) and the rulers of the Kittim
(Romans). Also, the Nahum Commentary’s historical perspective
extends from Antiochus (no doubt Epiphanes, c. 170 BCE) to the
conquest by the Kittim (probably 63 BCE). Names familiar from
Jewish or Graeco-Roman history appear here and there. The Nahum
Commentary alludes to Antiochus, and to another Syrian Greek king,
Demetrius (most likely Demetrius III at the beginning of the first century
BCE). Very fragmentary historical calendars from Cave 4 contain the
phrase ‘Aemilius killed’, meaning no doubt Aemilius Scaurus,
governor of Syria at the time of Pompey’s conquest of Jerusalem in
63. They mention also Jewish rulers of the Maccabaean—
Hasmonaean era (second-first centuries BCE), Shelamzion or
Salome-Alexandra, widow and successor of Alexander Jannaeus (76-
67 BCE); Hyrcanus and John (Yohanan), either John Hyrcanus I
(135/4-104 BCE) or more likely II (63-40 BCE),42 and King Jonathan,
Alexander Jannaeus or, in my opinion, more likely Jonathan
Maccabaeus (161-143/2 BCE).43 In one respect, despite the absence
of detail, the evidence is telling: all these characters belong to the
second or the first half of the first century BCE. So also do most of the
coins discovered at Qumran.
The mainstream hypothesis, built on archaeology and literary
analysis, sketches the history of the Scrolls Community (or Essene
sect) as follows.44 Its prehistory starts in Palestine - some claim also


---

## Page 42

Babylonian antecedents - with the rise of the Hasidic movement, at the
beginning of the second century BCE as described in the first book of
the Maccabees (I Mac. ii, 42-44; vii, 13-17). Sectarian (Essene)
history itself originated in a clash between the Wicked Priest or Priests
(Jonathan and/or possibly Simon Maccabaeus) and the Teacher of
Righteousness, the anonymous priest who was the spiritual leader of
the Community. The sect consisted of the survivors of the Hasidim,
linked with a group of dissident priests who, by the mid-second
century, came under the leadership of the sons of Zadok, associates
of the Zadokite high priests. This history continues at Qumran, and no
doubt in many other Palestinian localities, until the years of the first
Jewish rebellion against Rome, when possibly in 68 CE the settlement
is believed to have been occupied by Vespasian’s soldiers. Whether
the legionaries encountered sectarian resistance - such a theory would
be consonant with Josephus’ reference to an Essene general among
the revolutionaries45 and to a massacre of the Essenes by the
Romans46 - or whether the threatening presence of the contingents of
Zealot Sicarii, who had already expelled the Essenes from Qumran,
provoked a Roman intervention, are purely speculative matters. One
fact is certain, however. No one of the original occupants of Qumran
returned to the caves to reclaim their valuable manuscripts.
A variation on this theme, called the Groningen hypothesis,
postulates a whole series of six Wicked Priests, and identifies the
Community not with the main Essene sect but with one of its splinter
groups.47 The Zealot theory, elaborated in the 1950s in Oxford by Sir
Godfrey Driver and Cecil Roth,48 is hard to reconcile with the totality of
the available evidence, as most of the Qumran documents predate the
Zealot period.
More recently Norman Golb of Chicago has launched a forceful
attack on the common opinion. His objections, reiterated in a series of
papers,49 culminated in 1995 in a hefty tome.50 The target of his
criticism is the provenance of the scrolls found at Qumran. According
to him, the manuscripts originated in a Jerusalem library (or libraries),
the contents of which were concealed in desert caves when the capital
was besieged between 67 and 70 CE. The chief corollary of the


---

## Page 43

hypothesis is that the Essenes had nothing to do either with the
Qumran settlement - a fortress in Golb’s opinion51 - or with the
manuscripts.
The early assumption of Scroll scholars that every non-biblical Dead
Sea text was an Essene writing52 might have justified to some extent
Norman Golb’s scepticism. But nowadays specialists distinguish
between Qumran manuscripts written by members of the Essene sect,
and others either predating the Community, or simply brought there
from outside. Emanuel Tov, for instance, has drawn a dividing line on
scribal grounds between scrolls produced at Qumran and the rest.53
However, in my view the soft underbelly of the Jerusalem hypothesis is
revealed - apart from the patent weakness of the archaeological
interpretation, for Qumran is not a fortress - by the composition of the
manuscript collection itself, definitely pointing towards a sectarian
library. If Cave 4 is taken as representative, whereas several biblical
books (Kings, Lamentations, Ezra and Chronicles) are attested only in
single copies; and others, as important as Numbers, Joshua, Judges,
Proverbs, Ruth and Ecclesiastes, in two copies, we find ten copies of
the Community Rule and nine of the Damascus Document. Over a
dozen manuscripts contain sectarian calendars, yet not one
mainstream calendar figures among the 575 (or 555) compositions
found in that cave! So, if the texts discovered at Qumran came from
the capital, can their source have been an Essene library in
Jerusalem?54
QUMRAN AND THE NEW TESTAMENT
Since Qumran and early Christianity partly overlap, it is not surprising
that from the very beginning of Dead Sea Scrolls research some
scholars endeavoured to identify the two. The first attempt came from
England in the early 1950s, with Jacob Teicher of Cambridge
modestly advancing the thesis that Jesus was the Teacher of
Righteousness and Saint Paul the Wicked Priest.55 This trend was
continued with loud media support by J. M. Allegro’s speculation about


---

## Page 44

the role of ammanita muscaria, a hallucinogenic fungus, in the
genesis of the Christian Church.56 It reached its climax with Barbara
Thiering’s discovery that John the Baptist was the Teacher of
Righteousness and the married, divorced and remarried Jesus, father
of four children, the Wicked Priest.57 As for Robert Eisenman, he
ignores Jesus, and casts instead his brother, James, in the role of the
Teacher of Righteousness, with Paul playing the Wicked Priest.58 In
my opinion all these theories fail the basic credibility test: they do not
spring from, but are foisted on, the texts.59
These - to say the least - improbable speculations as well as the no
less fantastic claim that Qumran Cave 7 yielded remains of the Gospel
of Mark and other New Testament writings in Greek60 need not detain
us any longer.
Turning to the real relationship between the Scrolls and the New
Testament, this can be presented under a threefold heading. (1) We
note (a) fundamental similarities of language (both in the Scrolls and in
the New Testament the faithful are called ‘sons of light’); (b) ideology
(both communities considered themselves as the true Israel, governed
by twelve leaders, and expected the imminent arrival of the Kingdom of
God); (c) attitude to the Bible (both considered their own history as a
fulfilment of the words of the Prophets). However, all correspondences
such as these may be due to the Palestinian religious atmosphere of
the epoch, without entailing any direct influence.
(2) More specific features, such as monarchic administration (i.e.
single leaders, overseers at Qumran, bishops in Christian
communities) and the practice of religious communism in the strict
discipline of the sect and at least in the early days in the Jerusalem
church (cf. Acts ii, 44-5), would suggest a direct causal connection. If
so, it is likely that the young and inexperienced church modelled itself
on the by then well-tried Essene society.
(3) In the study of the historical Jesus, the charismatic-
eschatological aspects of the Scrolls have provided the richest
gleanings for comparison. For example, the Prayer of Nabonidus,
known since the mid-1950s,61 and concerned with the story of
Nabonidus’ cure by a Jewish exorcist who forgave his sins, provides

the most telling parallel to the Gospel account of the healing of a
paralytic in Capernaum whose sins Jesus declared forgiven.62
The second example is the so-called Resurrection fragment
(4Q521, cf. below, pp. 412-3).63 In this poem, the age of the
eschatological kingdom is characterized, with the help of Psalm cxlvi,
7-8 and Isaiah lxi, 1, by the liberation of captives, the curing of the
blind, the straightening of the bent, the healing of the wounded, the
raising of the dead and the proclamation of the good news to the poor.
Likewise, in the Gospels, victory over disease and the devil is viewed
as the sure sign of the initial manifestation of God’s reign. Jesus is
reported to have announced:
If it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, the Kingdom of God
has come upon you.
(Lk. xi, 20)
Similarly, to John the Baptist’s inquiry whether Jesus was the final
messenger the following reply is sent:
Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, and
the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are
raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.
(Matth. xi, 4-5)
Note furthermore that Community Rule 4:6 lists healing as the chief
eschatological reward and that according to the Palestinian Aramaic
paraphrases of Genesis iii, 15 the days of the Messiah will bring an
ultimate cure to the children of Eve wounded by the serpent in the
garden of Eden.64
QUMRAN’S GREATEST NOVELTY
If one had to single out the most revolutionary novelty furnished by
Qumran, its contribution to our understanding of the genesis of Jewish


---

## Page 46

literary compositions could justifiably be our primary choice.
Comparative study of biblical manuscripts, where no two copies
display the same text, and of sectarian works, attested in a number of
sometimes startlingly different redactions, has revealed in one leading
scholar’s words ‘insufficiently controlled copying’.65 In my view,
however, the phenomenon would better be described as scribal
creative freedom. Qumran manuscripts of Scripture, and even more of
the Community Rule and the War Scroll, indicate that diversity, not
uniformity, reigned there and then, and that redactor-copyists felt free
to improve the composition which they were reproducing. Or, to quote
myself,
The Dead Sea Scrolls have afforded for the first time direct insight into
the creative literary-religious process at work within that variegated
Judaism which flourished during the last two centuries of quasi-
national independence, before the catastrophe of 70 CE forced the
rabbinic successors of the Pharisees to attempt to create an
‘orthodoxy’ by reducing dangerous multiplicity to a simple, tidy and
easily controllable unity.66
Looking at the Qumran discoveries from an overall perspective, it is - I
believe - the student of the history of Palestinian Judaism in the inter-
Testamental era (150 BCE-70 CE) who is their principal beneficiary.
For such an expert, the formerly quite unknown sectarian writings of the
Dead Sea literature have opened new avenues of exploration in the
shadowy era of the life of Jesus, the rise of Christianity and the
emergence of rabbinic Judaism. From the Jewish side, it was
previously poorly documented. The rabbis of the first and second
centuries CE had not permitted religious writings of that epoch to go
down to posterity unless they conformed fully to their ideas, and
although some of these texts were preserved by Christians (viz. the
Apocrypha and many of the Pseudepigrapha), the fact that they had
served as a vehicle for Church apologetics caused their textual
reliability to be suspect. But the Scrolls are unaffected by either
Christian or rabbinic censorship, and now that their evidence is


---

## Page 47

complete, historians will be thoroughly acquainted, not with just another
aspect of Jewish beliefs or customs, but with the whole organization,
teaching and aspirations of a religious community flourishing during
the last centuries of the Second Temple.
The Scrolls have understandably awakened intense interest in the
academic world, but why have they appealed so strongly to the
imagination of the non-specialist? I would say, the outstanding
characteristic of our age appears to be a desire to reach back to the
greatest attainable purity, to the basic truth free of jargon. Affecting the
whole of our outlook, it has necessarily included the domain of
religious thought and behaviour, and with it, in the Western world, the
whole subject of Judaeo-Christian culture and spirituality. A search is
being made for the original meaning of issues with which we have
become almost too familiar and which with the passing of the centuries
have tended to become choked with inessentials, and it has led not
only to a renewed preoccupation with the primitive but fully developed
expression of these issues in the Scriptures, but also to a desire for
knowledge and understanding of their prehistory.
The laws and rules, hymns and other liturgical works as well as the
Bible commentaries of the Qumran Community respond to this need in
that they add substance and depth to the historical period in which
Jewish Christianity and rabbinic Judaism originated. They reveal one
facet of the spiritual ferment at work among the various Palestinian
religious parties at that time, a ferment which culminated in a thorough
re-examination and reinterpretation of the fundamentals of the Jewish
faith. By dwelling in such detail on the intimate organization of their
society, on the role attributed to their Teacher and on their ultimate
hopes and expectations, the sect of the Scrolls has exposed its own
resulting synthesis. This in its turn has thrown into relief and added a
new dimension to its dissenting contemporaries. Thus, compared with
the ultra-conservative rigidity of the Essene Rule, rabbinic Judaism
reveals itself as progressive and flexible, while the religion preached
and practised by Jesus of Nazareth stands out invested with religious
individuality and actuality. Also, by comparison to all three, the
ideology of the Gentile Church sounds a definitely alien note.67 Yet at
the same time, the common ground from which they all sprang, and


---

## Page 48

their affinities and borrowings, show themselves more clearly than ever
before. It is no exaggeration to state that none of these religious
movements can properly be understood independently of the others.
Essenism is dead. The brittle structure of its stiff and exclusive
brotherhood was unable to withstand the national catastrophe which
struck Palestinian Judaism in 70 CE. Animated by the loftiest of ideals
and devoted to the observance of ‘perfect holiness’, it yet lacked the
pliant strength and the elasticity of thought and depth of spiritual vision
which enabled rabbinic Judaism to survive and flourish. And although
the Teacher of Righteousness clearly sensed the deeper obligations
implicit in the Mosaic Law, he was without the genius of Jesus the Jew
who succeeded in uncovering the essence of religion as an existential
relationship between man and man and man and God.

II. The Community
Since the early 1950s, the information garnered from the Scrolls and
from Qumran’s archaeological remains has been combined by experts
to form a persuasive portrait of the people to which they allude. Yet for
all the advances made in knowledge and understanding, the enigma of
the sect is by no means definitely solved. After all this time, we are still
not certain that we have collated the whole evidence correctly or
interpreted it properly. Questions continue to arise in the mind and
there is still no way to be sure of the answers.
Our perplexity is mainly due to an absence in the documents, singly
or together, of any systematic exposition of the sect’s constitution and
laws. The Community Rule legislates for a group of ascetics living in a
kind of ‘monastic’ society, the statutes of the Damascus Document for
an ordinary lay existence; MMT (Miqsat Ma‘ase ha-Torah, or Some
Observances of the Law) probably echoes the prehistory or early
history of the sect; and the War Rule and Messianic Rule in their turn,
while associated with the Community Rule and the Damascus
Document, and no doubt reflecting to some extent a contemporary
state of affairs, first and foremost plan for a future age.
Taken together, however, it is clear from this literature that the
sectaries regarded themselves as the true Israel, the repository of the
authentic traditions of the religious body from which they had seceded.
Accordingly, they organized their movement so that it corresponded
faithfully to that of the Jewish people, dividing it into priests and laity (or
Aaron and Israel), and the laity grouped after the biblical model into
twelve tribes. This structure is described in the War Scroll’s account of
reconstituted Temple worship as it was expected to be at the end of
time:
... the twelve chief Priests shall minister at the daily sacrifice before God
... Below them ... shall be the chiefs of the Levites to the number of twelve,
one for each tribe ... Below them shall be the chiefs of the tribes ...
(IQM 11, 1-3)


---

## Page 50

Still following the biblical pattern, sectarian society (apart from the tribe
of Levi) was further distinguished into units of Thousands, Hundreds,
Fifties and Tens (IQS 11, 21; CD XIII, 1-2). To what extent these
figures are symbolical, we do not know, but it is improbable that
‘Thousands’ amounted to anything more than a figure of speech. It is
not irrelevant, in this connection, to note that the archaeologists have
deduced from the fact that the cemetery contained 1,100 graves, dug
over the course of roughly 200 years, that the population of Qumran, an
establishment of undoubted importance, can never have numbered
more than 150 to 200 souls at a time. Also, it should be borne in mind
that the total membership of the Essene sect in the first century CE
only slightly exceeded ‘four thousand’ (Josephus, Antiquities XVIII, 21).
To consider now the two types separately, the ‘monastic’
brotherhood at Qumran alludes to itself in the Community Rule as ‘the
men of holiness’ and ‘the men of perfect holiness’, and to the sect as
‘the Community’ and ‘Council of the Community’ or ‘the men of the
Law’ (4QSd=4Q258). The establishment was devoted exclusively to
religion. Work must have formed a necessary part of their existence; it
is obvious from the remains discovered at Qumran that they farmed,
made pots, cured hides and reproduced manuscripts. But no
indication of this appears in the documents. It is said only that they
were to ‘eat in common and bless in common and deliberate in
common’ (IQS VI, 2-3), living in such a way as to ‘seek God with a
whole heart and soul’ (IQS 1, 1-2). Perfectly obedient to each and
every one of the laws of Moses and to all that was commanded by the
Prophets, they were to love one another and to share with one another
their ‘knowledge, powers and possessions’ (IQS I, II). They were to be
scrupulous in their observance of the times appointed for prayer, and
for every other aspect of a liturgical existence conducted apart from
the Temple of Jerusalem and its official cult. ‘Separate from the
habitation of unjust men’ (IQS VIII, 13), they were to study the Torah in
the wilderness and thereby ‘atone for the Land’ (IQS VIII, 6, 10) and its
wicked men, for whom they were to nourish an ‘everlasting hatred’
(IQS ix, 21), though this went together with a firm conviction that their


---

## Page 51

fate was in God’s hands alone. And the poet proclaims in the Hymn
with which the Community Rule ends:
I will pay to no man the reward of evil;
I will pursue him with goodness.
For judgement of all the living is with God
And it is He who will render to man his reward.
(IQS x, 17-18)
They were to be truthful, humble, just, upright, charitable and modest.
They were to
watch in community for a third of every night of the year, to read the Book
and to study the Law and to bless together.
(IQS VI, 7-8)
These are, as may be seen, mostly the sort of recommendations to be
expected of men devoting themselves to contemplation. A point to
bear in mind, however, is that the contemplative life is not a regular
feature of Judaism. An additional distinctive trait of these sectaries is
that another qualification was required of them besides holiness: they
were expected to become proficient in the knowledge of the ‘two
spirits’ in which all men ‘walk’, the spirits of truth and falsehood, and to
learn how to discriminate between them. They were taught in the so-
called ‘instruction concerning the Two Spirits’, the earliest Jewish
theological tractate incorporated into the Community Rule, how to
recognize a ‘son of Light’ or potential ‘son of Light’, and how to
distinguish a ‘son of Darkness’ belonging to the lot of Belial (IQS III, 13-
IV, 25; cf. below pp. 73-4).
The hierarchy at Qumran was strict and formal, from the highest level
to the lowest. Every sectary was inscribed in ‘the order of his rank’
(IQS VI, 22) - the term ‘order’ recurs constantly - and was obliged to
keep to it in all the Community meetings and at table, an order that
was subject to an annual review on the Feast of the Renewal of the
Covenant. But after democratic beginnings, with the ‘Congregation’
(literally, ‘the Many’) as such forming the supreme authority, testified to


---

## Page 52

by what seems to be the earliest formulation of the communal
constitution (cf. 4QSb,d=4Q256, 258, see below, pp. 118-19), the
‘sons of Zadok, the priests’, members of the ‘Zadokite’ high-priestly
family, took over the leadership of the sect. Although nothing to this
effect is mentioned specifically in the Community Rule, the superior,
the so-called mebaqqer or Guardian, was undoubtedly one of their
number, as was the Bursar of the Congregation entrusted with
handling the material affairs of the Community. In their hands lay the
ultimate responsibility for decisions on matters of doctrine, discipline,
purity and impurity, and in particular everything pertaining to ‘justice
and property’ (IQS IX, 7). It was also a basic rule of the order that a
priest was required to be present at any gathering of ten or more
members who were meeting for debate, Bible study or prayer. A priest
was to recite the grace before the common meals and to pronounce
blessings (IQS VI, 3-8). He was no doubt the man whose duty it was to
study the Law continually (IQS VI, 7; VIII, 11-12). One interesting
feature of the priesthood at Qumran is that their precedence was
absolute. In Judaism as represented by the Mishnah, the priest is
superior to the Levite, the Levite to the Israelite, and the Israelite to the
‘bastard’ (Horayot III, 8). But the priestly precedence is conditional. If
the ‘bastard’ is a man of learning, we are told, and the High Priest an
uneducated ‘boor’, ‘the bastard ... precedes the High Priest’.
The highest office was vested in the person of the Guardian, known
also, it would seem, as the ‘Master’ (maskil). The Community was to
be taught by him how to live in conformity with the ‘Book of the
Community Rule’ (IQS 1, 1; 4QSa=4Q255), and to be instructed by him
in the doctrine of the ‘two spirits’. He was to preside over assemblies,
giving leave to speak to those wishing to do so (IQS VI, 11-13). He
was to assess, in concert with the brethren, the spiritual progress of
the men in his charge and rank them accordingly (IQS VI, 21-2). And
negatively, he was not to dispute with ‘the men of the Pit (or Dawn)’
and not to transmit to them the sect’s teachings (IQS IX, 16-17). Of the
sect’s institutions, the most significant appears to have been the
Council of the Community, or assembly of the Congregation. From a
passage ordering all the members to sit in their correct places - ‘the
Priests shall sit first, and the elders second, and all the rest of the


---

## Page 53

people according to their rank’ (IQS VI, 8-9) - the Council seems to
have been a gathering of the whole community, under the priests and
men of importance, marshalled by the Levites, and with the Guardian
at the head. But in another text, generally held to be an early section,
the rule is as follows:
In the Council of the Community there shall be twelve men and three
Priests, perfectly versed in all that is revealed of the Law, whose works
shall be truth, righteousness, justice, loving-kindness and humility. They
shall preserve the faith in the Land with steadfastness and meekness and
shall atone for sin by the practice of justice and by suffering the sorrows of
affliction. They shall walk with all men according to the standard of truth
and the rule of the time.
(IQS VIII, 1-4)
These three priests and twelve men are referred to also as ‘fifteen
men’ in a hybrid version of the Community Rule and the Damascus
Document (4Q265 fr. 7 ii). Their presence was obviously essential:
both documents state that when they ‘are in Israel, the Council of the
Community shall be established in truth’ (IQS VIII, 4-5; 4Q265 fr. 7 ii, 7-
8). But whether they formed the nucleus of the sect as a whole, or the
minimum quorum of the leadership of the Community, symbolically
portrayed as consisting of the twelve tribes and the three Levitical
clans, or a special elite within the Council designated elsewhere ‘the
Foundations of the Community’, must be left open to question. The
purpose of the meetings is in any case clear. It was to debate the Law,
to discuss their current business, to select or reject newcomers under
the guidance of the Guardian, to hear charges against offenders and
to conduct a yearly inquiry into the progress of every sectary,
promoting or demoting them in rank, again under the Guardian’s
supervision (IQS v, 23-4; VI, 13-23). During their sessions, order and
quiet were to prevail: a person wishing to offer his opinion or ask a
question was to crave permission in a prescribed way. He was to rise
and tell the Guardian and the Congregation, ‘I have something to say
to the Congregation’ and then wait for their consent before going
ahead (IQS VI, 8-13).
The procedure followed in inquiries into infringements of the Law


---

## Page 54

and the sect’s Rule has been preserved, and the list of faults with their
corresponding sentences tells us more about the mentality of the Dead
Sea ascetics than any isolated exposition of their doctrine and
principles can do.
Beginning with the blackest sins: any transgression, by commission
or omission, of ‘one word of the Law of Moses, on any point whatever’
earned outright expulsion. No former companion might from then on
associate with the sinner in any way at all (IQS VIII, 21-4). Expulsion
followed, secondly, the pronouncement for any reason whatever of the
divine Name:
If any man has uttered the [Most] Venerable Name, even though
frivolously, or as a result of shock, or for any other reason whatever, while
reading the Book or blessing, he shall be dismissed and shall return ... no
more.
(IQS VI, 27-VII, 2)
Thirdly, a sectary was expelled for slandering the Congregation (IQS
VII, 16). Fourthly, he was sent away for rebelling against the
‘Foundations’ of the Community:
Whoever has murmured against the authority of the Community shall be
expelled and shall not return.
(IQS VII, 17)
Lastly, where a man had been a member of the Council for at least ten
years and had then defected to ‘walk in the stubbornness of his heart’, not
only was he to be expelled, but the same judgement was extended to any
of his former colleagues who might take pity on him and share with him
their food or money
(IQS VII, 22-3).
The remaining offences are of a kind that might be confessed and
censured in any Christian religious order of today, though one cannot
perhaps say the same of the penances imposed for them.
In a descending order of gravity: a man who ‘betrayed the truth and


---

## Page 55

walked in the stubbornness of his heart’ (IQS VII, 18-21), or
transgressed the Mosaic Law inadvertently (IQS VIII, 24-IX, I), was
visited with two years of penance. He was to lose his rank and during
the first year be separated from the ‘purity’ of the Congregation, and
during the second year, from its ‘drink’. Both notions will be developed
presently. He was then to be re-examined by the Congregation and
subsequently returned to his place in the order.
Lying in matters of property, in all probability the partial concealment
of personal possessions, earned exclusion from ‘purity’ for a year and
a cut by one quarter in the food ration (IQS VI, 25-7). The penal code of
4Q265, which closely resembles that of IQS, prescribes for deceiving
a companion an exclusion for six months and a halving of the guilty
person’s food portion. Disrespect to a companion of higher rank,
rudeness and anger towards a priest, slander and deliberate insult, all
earned one year of penance and exclusion from ‘purity’ (IQS VI, 25-7;
VII, 2-5). After this, the sentences decrease to six months, three
months, thirty days and ten days of penance.
For lying deliberately and similarly deceiving by word or deed, for
bearing malice unjustly, for taking revenge, for murmuring against a
companion unjustly and also for going ‘naked before his companion,
without having been obliged to do so’ - a curious proviso - the sectary
was to atone for six months. For failing to care for a companion and for
speaking foolishly: three months. For falling asleep during a meeting of
the Council, for leaving the Council while members were standing (in
prayer?), for spitting in Council, for ‘guffawing foolishly’, for being ‘so
poorly dressed that when drawing his hand from beneath his garment
his nakedness has been seen’: thirty days. The penal code contained
in another of the Cave 4 manuscripts of the Damascus Document
(4Q266) mentions also ten days’ penance, in addition to the thirty
days’ expulsion inflicted on someone who has fallen asleep during a
meeting! And for leaving an assembly three times without reason, for
interrupting another while speaking, for gesticulating with the left hand:
ten days (IQS VII, 15). A fascinating fragment (4Q477) has preserved
in writing cases of misbehaviour by named sectaries: ‘Yohanan son of
...’ was ‘short-tempered’; ‘Hananiah Notos’ led astray ‘the spirit of the
Community’ and either pampered himself or showed favouritism to his


---

## Page 56

near kin(?); and another ‘Hananiah son of Sim[on]’ ‘loved’ something
no doubt prohibited.
That the common table was of high importance to Qumran daily life
is evident from the fact that only the fully professed and the faultless,
that is to say those who were ‘inscribed ... for purity’ and not
subsequently disqualified, were allowed to sit at it. There is no explicit
mention of a ritual bath preceding the meals, but from various
references to purification by water, as well as the presence of bathing
installations at Qumran, it is likely that the sectaries immersed
themselves before eating as did the Essenes according to Josephus
(War 11, 129). But little more is learnt of the meal itself from the
Community Rule than that when the table had been ‘prepared for
eating, and the new wine for drinking’, the priest was to be the first to
bless the food and drink (IQS VI, 4-5). The implication would be that
after him the others did the same, an inference supported by the
Messianic Rule, where a similar meal is described attended by two
Messiahs (IQSa II, 17-21). Some uncertainty surrounds the meaning of
‘new wine’, but it would seem from the use in the Scrolls (with the
exception of the Temple Scroll), of the alternative Hebrew words for
wine - tirosh and yayin - that the latter often has pejorative
connotations. More likely than not, the ‘wine’ drunk by the sectaries,
‘the drink of the Congregation’, was unfermented grape-juice.
Another topic to be considered under the heading of communal life
and institutions is the crucial one of induction into the sect. And if it
should seem strange to place it towards the end rather than at the
beginning, the explanation is that with an idea, however sketchy, of
what was entailed by adherence to the movement, the process by
which it admitted a Jew into its company becomes easier to follow.
According to the regime adopted at Qumran, a person desiring to join
the sect remained on probation, certainly for two years and possibly for
three or more. His first move was to appear before the Guardian ‘at
the head of the Congregation’, meaning no doubt during a session of
the Congregation, who inquired into his principles to discover if he was
a suitable postulant. If they were satisfied, he ‘entered the Covenant’
(IQS VI, 13-15). That is to say, he solemnly swore there and then to
adhere to the Torah as the sect interpreted it, vowing


---

## Page 57

by a binding oath to return with all his heart and soul to every
commandment of the Law of Moses in accordance with all that has been
revealed of it to the sons of Zadok... the Keepers of the Covenant.
(IQS v, 7-9)
After a further period of unspecified length, during which he received
instruction from the Guardian ‘in all the rules of the Community’, he
appeared once more before the Congregation, who confirmed him as
a novice or dismissed him. But although he was now accepted into the
Council of the Community, he was nevertheless still not admitted to
‘purity’ for another full year. The same rule applied also in the group
represented by 4Q265 fr. 1.
This concept of pure things (tohorah, taharah or tohorot, literally
‘purity’ or ‘purities’) needs some comment. It seems to designate here
as in rabbinic literature ritually pure food (cf. also 4Q274 I), as well as
the vessels and utensils in which it is contained or cooked. It includes
also garments. The tohorot, moreover, are distinguished by the rabbis
from mashqin, liquids, the latter being considered much more
susceptible to contract impurity than solid comestibles. Hence, in
ordering the novice not to touch the pure things of the Congregation,
the Community forbade him all contact with its pots, plates, bowls and
necessarily the food that they held. He was not, in effect, to attend the
common table and had to eat elsewhere. Although the context is very
different, a parallel rule figures in the Temple Scroll (LXIII, 13-14),
prohibiting a Gentile woman married to her Jewish captor to touch his
tohorah for seven years.
During this first year of the novitiate, the newcomer could not share
the sect’s property. At a third Community inquiry, he was examined for
‘his understanding and observance of the Law’ and, if his progress
was judged to be adequate, he handed over his money and
belongings to the ‘Bursar of the Congregation’, but they were set aside
and not yet absorbed into Community ownership. During this second
year, furthermore, the ban on touching the pure things was relaxed, but
he could still not touch liquids, the ‘Drink [mashqeh] of the
Congregation’ (IQS VI, 20-21; VII, 20; cf. also 4Q284 I). Finally, with the


---

## Page 58

second year over, the novice had once more to undergo an
examination, after which, ‘according to the judgement of the
Congregation’, he was at last inscribed among the brethren in the
order of his rank ‘for the Law, and for justice, and for purity’. Also, his
property was amalgamated with theirs and he possessed the right
from then on to speak his mind in the Council of the Community (IQS
VI, 13-23).
In sum, this strict and extended curriculum falls into two stages. The
postulant is first brought into the Covenant, swearing total fidelity to the
Mosaic Law as interpreted by the sect’s priestly teachers, and to
‘separate from all the men of injustice who walk in the way of
wickedness’ (IQS v, 10-11). He then secondly embarks on a course of
training as a preliminary to joining the ‘holy Congregation’ (IQS v, 20).
In other words, entering the Covenant and entering the Community was
not one act, but two.
It has long been debated whether the Qumran sectaries were
married or celibate. From the image of their life projected so far on the
basis of the Community Rule, few will probably disagree that the idea
of the presence of women among them appears incongruous. The
impression received is that of a wholly masculine society: indeed, they
were actually enjoined not to ‘follow a sinful heart and lustful eyes,
committing all manner of evil’ (IQS 1, 6). In further support of the
argument for celibacy, the word ishah, woman, occurs nowhere in the
Community Rule. Or rather, to be more exact, it is encountered once in
the final Hymn, in the cliché, ‘one born of woman’ (IQS xi, 21).
Moreover, against the Cave 4 Damascus Document regulation
(4Q270 fr. 7), which envisages a membership of married people and
imposes the penalty of expulsion on anyone murmuring against ‘the
Fathers’ but only a ten-day penance for murmuring against ‘the
Mothers’, the Community Rule speaks only of the crime of murmuring
against ‘the authority of the Community’ (IQS VII, 17). Silence
concerning the presence of women seems therefore deliberate. Yet
the fact cannot be overlooked that although in the main graveyard itself
the twenty-six tombs so far opened at random (out of 1,100) have all
contained adult male skeletons, the archaeologists have uncovered on
the peripheries of the cemetery the bones of six women and three


---

## Page 59

children too (R. de Vaux, Archaeology and the Dead Sea Scrolls, 47-
8; J.-P. Humbert, Fouilles de Kh. Qumrân, 346-52). A more extensive
exploration of the cemetery would eliminate most of these
uncertainties.
The Damascus Document, the hybrid Community Rule-Damascus
Document text (4Q265) and the Temple Scroll, as well as the
Messianic Rule and occasionally the War Rule and MMT, are
concerned with a style of religious existence quite at variance with that
at Qumran. In the ‘towns’ or ‘camps’, as the Damascus Document
terms them (CD XII, 19, 23), adherents of the sect lived an urban or
village life side by side with, yet apart from, their fellow Jewish and
Gentile neighbours. They had wives and reared children, but clearly
their sexual morality followed particularly strict rules. A Cave 4
Damascus Document manuscript lays down that ‘whoever has
approached his wife, not according to the rules, (thus) fornicating, he
shall leave and will not return again’ (4Q270 fr. 7 i). The married
sectaries employed servants, engaged in commerce and trade (even
with Gentiles), tended cattle, grew vines and corn in the surrounding
fields, and discharged their duties to the Temple by way of offerings,
but in doing so they were obliged like their brothers in the desert to
show absolute obedience to the Law and to observe the sect’s
‘appointed times’. There is no indication, however, that the continual
and intensive study of the Torah played any part in their lives. Nor in
their regard is there any mention of instruction in the doctrine of the two
spirits, as membership of the group was a birthright and not the
outcome of a process of selection and training.
How many of these people, if any, lived in Jerusalem is not known,
but they must at least have visited the city from time to time, since a
statute forbids them to enter the ‘house of worship’ (possibly the
Temple) in a state of ritual uncleanness, or to ‘lie with a woman in the
city of the Sanctuary to defile the city of the Sanctuary with their
uncleanness’ (CD I, 22; XII, 1; TS XLV, 11-12).
Little is revealed in the Damascus Document of how the life span of
the individual progressed in the ‘towns’, and for this we have to turn to
the Messianic Rule in the hope that it reflects contemporary actuality
as well as the ideal life of an age to come.

According to the latter Rule, members of the Covenant were
permitted to marry at the age of twenty, when they were estimated to
have reached adulthood and to ‘know [good] and evil’ (IQSa 1, 9-11).
For the subsequent five years they were then allowed to ‘assist’ (as
opposed to taking an active part) at hearings and judgements. At
twenty-five, they advanced one grade further and qualified to ‘work in
the service of the Congregation’ (IQSa 1, 12-13). At thirty, they were
regarded as at last fully mature and could ‘participate’ in the affairs of
the tribunals and assemblies, taking their place among the higher
ranks of the sect, the ‘chiefs of the thousands of Israel, the chiefs of the
Hundreds, Fifties and Tens, the Judges and the officers of their tribes,
in all their families, [under the authority] of the sons of [Aar]on the
Priests’ (IQSa 1, 8-16). As office-holders, they were expected to
perform their duties to the best of their ability and were accorded more
honour or less in conformity with their ‘understanding’ and the
‘perfection’ of their ‘way’. As they grew older, so their burdens became
lighter (IQSa 1, 19).
As at Qumran, supreme authority rested in the hands of the priests,
and every group of ten or more was to include a priest ‘learned in the
Book of Meditation’ and to be ‘ruled by him’ (CD XIII, 2-3). His
precedence, on the other hand, is not represented as absolute in the
‘towns’. It is explicitly stated that in the absence of a properly qualified
priest, he was to be replaced by a Levite who would perform all the
functions of a superior except those specially reserved in the Bible to
the priesthood such as applying the laws of leprosy (CD XIII, 3-7). The
Cave 4 manuscripts of the Damascus Document (4Q266, 269, 272-3)
describe at length the diagnosis of the onset and eventual cure of skin
disease. Priests with speech defects, those who had been prisoners
of war or had settled and been active among Gentiles were
disqualified from performing priestly duties or eating ‘sacred food’
(4Q266 fr. 5). The Cave 4 version of the Damascus Document
legislates also on agricultural priestly dues (4Q266 fr. 6; 271fr. 2).
As in the Community Rule, the head of the ‘camp’ is designated in
the Damascus Document, as well as in 4QDa (4Q266 fr. 5 i) and in the
hybrid 4Q265 fr. 1 ii, as the mebaqqer or Guardian. He appears,
however, not to be supported by a council. In fact, the words ‘Council of


---

## Page 61

the Community’ are absent from this document apart from the
transitional 4Q265 frs. 1 ii and 7 ii, where the use of the term is more
general in the first case and represents the ideal nucleus of the sect in
the second. There is reference to the ‘company of Israel’, on the advice
of which it would be licit to attack Gentiles (CD XII, 8), but this type of
war council, mentioned also in the Messianic Rule (IQSa 1, 26), can
surely have had nothing to do with the assemblies described in the
Community Rule. (The only possible parallel is the ‘council of Holiness’
in CD xx, 24, in which a not strictly observant member was to be
judged.) The Guardian of the ‘camps’, in any case, stands on his own
as teacher and helper of his people. He shall love them, writes the
author,
as a father loves his children, and shall carry them in all their distress
like a shepherd his sheep. He shall loosen all the fetters which bind them
that in his Congregation there may be none that are oppressed or broken.
(CD XIII, 9-10)
The Guardian was to examine newcomers to his congregation, though
not, it should be noted, to determine their ‘spirit’, and was to serve as
the deciding authority on the question of their admission (cf. also
4Q265 fr. 1 ii). These offices are of course already familiar to us from
the Community Rule. But an additional task of the mebaqqer in the
towns was to ensure that no friendly contact occurred between his
congregation and anyone outside the sect. Whatever exchanges took
place had to be paid for; and even these transactions were to be
subject to his consent (CD XIII, 14-16).
Instead of dealing with offenders in Community courts of inquiry, the
towns had their tribunals for hearing cases, equipped moreover with
‘judges’. These were to be ten in number, elected for a specific term
and drawn from the tribes of Levi, Aaron and Israel: four priests and
Levites, and six laymen (CD x, 4-7). They were to be not younger than
twenty-five and not older than sixty - in the Messianic Rule, which also
speaks of judges, the age-limits are thirty and sixty years (IQSa 1, 13-
15) - and were to be expert in biblical law and the ‘constitutions of the
Covenant’. The arrangement would seem, in fact, to be fairly


---

## Page 62

straightforward. Yet it is not entirely so. For example, it is evident that
the Guardian was also implicated in legal matters; he had to determine
whether a proper case had been made out against a sectary and
whether it should be brought before the court (CD ix, 16-20), and in
certain cases he appears to have imposed penalties on his own (CD
xv, 13-14). The ‘Priest overseeing the Congregation’ of one of the
Cave 4 fragments of the Damascus Document (4Q270 fr. 7 i-ii)
appears to perform the same single judicial function as the Guardian in
the case of an inadvertent sin. We are not told whether the ten judges
sat together, whether they were all drawn from the locality in which they
lived, or whether they travelled as it were on circuit as nowadays. The
code of law they were expected to administer, as laid down in the
Damascus Document, differs in content from that of the Community
Rule. Furthermore, although, unlike the Qumran code, a sentence is
prescribed only rarely, sometimes it is the death penalty. We have
here, in addition to matters relating primarily to communal discipline to
a large extent identical with the Community Rule, a more detailed
sectarian reformulation of scriptural laws regulating Jewish life as
such.
The first group of statutes, concerned with vows, opens with the
injunction that in order to avoid being put to death for the capital sin of
uttering the names of God, the sectary must swear by the Covenant
alone. Such an oath would be fully obligatory and might not be
cancelled (CD XVI, 7-8). If he subsequently violated his oath, he would
then have only to confess to the priest and make restitution (CD xv, 1-
5). The sectary is also ordered not to vow to the altar articles acquired
unlawfully, or the food of his own house (CD xvi, 13-15), and not to
make any vow ‘in the fields’ but always before the judges (CD IX, 9-
10). He is threatened with death if he ‘vows another to destruction by
the laws of the Gentiles’ (CD IX, 1). As for the right conferred by the
Bible on fathers and husbands to annul vows made by their daughters
or wives, the Damascus Document limits it to the cancellation of oaths
which should have never been made in the first place (CD XVI, 10-12;
for a somewhat different rule, see TS LIII, 16-LIV, 5). It is clearly stated
that no accusation is valid without prior warnings before witnesses
(CD IX, 2-3). A record of reported moral failings (4Q477) has already


---

## Page 63

been quoted (cf. above, pp. 31-2).
A few ordinances are concerned with witnesses. No one under the
age of twenty was to testify before the judges in a capital charge (CD
ix, 23-X, 2). Also, whereas the normal biblical custom is that two or
three witnesses are needed before any sentence can be pronounced
(Deut. xix, 15; cf. also IIQTS LXI, 6-12), a single witness being quite
unacceptable, unustestis nullus testis, sectarian law allowed the
indictment of a man guilty of repeating the same capital offence on the
testimony of single witnesses to the separate occasions on which it
was committed, providing they reported it to the Guardian at once and
that the Guardian recorded it at once in writing (CD IX, 17-20). With
regard to capital cases, to which should be added apostasy in a state
of demonic possession (CD XII, 2-3), the adultery of a betrothed girl
(4Q159, fr. 224, 10-11), slandering the people of Israel and treason
(TS LXIV, 6-13), it is highly unlikely that either the Jewish or the Roman
authorities would have granted any rights of execution to the sect. So
this is probably part of the sect’s vision of the future age, when it as
Israel de jure would constitute de facto the government of the chosen
people.
The penal code of the Damascus Document (4Q270) stipulates
irrevocable expulsion in the case of a man ‘fornicating’ with his wife.
This may refer to illicit sexual relations with a menstruating woman or,
perhaps more likely, with a pregnant or post-menopausal woman
since, as Josephus clearly states in connection with married Essenes,
sex between spouses was licit only if it could result in conception (War
11, 161).
A section devoted to Sabbath laws displays a marked bias towards
severity. In time, rabbinic law developed the Sabbath rules in still
greater detail than appears here, but the tendency is already manifest.
The sectary was not only to abstain from labour ‘on the sixth day
from the moment when the sun’s orb is distant by its own fullness from
the gate (wherein it sinks)’ (CD x, 15-16), he was not even to speak
about work. Nothing associated with money or gain was to interrupt his
Sabbath of rest (CD x, 18-19). No member of the Covenant of God
was to go out of his house on business on the Sabbath. In fact, he was
not to go out, for any reason, further than 1,000 cubits (about 500


---

## Page 64

yards), though he could pasture his beast at a distance of 2,000 cubits
from his town (CD x, 21; XI, 5-6). He could not cook. He could not pick
and eat fruit and other edible things ‘lying in the fields’. He could not
draw water and carry it away, but must drink where he found it (CD X,
22-3). He could not strike his beast or reprimand his servant (CD XI, 6,
12). He could not carry a child, wear perfume or sweep up the dust in
his house (CD XI, 10-11). He could not assist his animals to give birth
or help them if they fell into a pit; he could, however, pull a man out of
water or fire without the help of a ladder or rope (CD xi, 13-14, 16-17).
Interpreting the Bible restrictively (Lev. xxiii, 38), the sect’s lawmaker
(or makers) commanded him to offer no sacrifice on the Sabbath save
the Sabbath burnt-offering, and never to send a gift to the Temple by
the hand of one ‘smitten with any uncleanness permitting him thus to
defile the altar’ (CD xi, 19-20). He was also never to have intercourse
while in the ‘city of the Sanctuary’ (CD XII, 1-2; 11QTS XLV, 1-12).
The punishment imposed for profaning the Sabbath and the feasts
in any of these ways was not death as in the Bible (Num. XV, 35), nor
even expulsion as in the Community Rule. It was seven years’
imprisonment.
It shall fall to men to keep him in custody. And if he is healed of his error,
they shall keep him in custody for seven years and he shall afterwards
approach the Assembly.
(CD XII, 4-6)
In the last group, the ordinances appear to be only loosely connected,
though some of them involve relations with the larger Jewish-Gentile
world. One such forbids killing or stealing from a non-Jew, ‘unless so
advised by the company of Israel’ (CD XII, 6-8). Another proscribes the
sale to Gentiles of ritually pure beasts and birds, as well as the
produce of granary and wine-press, in case they should blaspheme by
offering them in heathen sacrifice. MMT further prohibits acceptance of
offerings (wheat or meat) by Gentiles (4Q394 frs. 3-7). A ban is
similarly laid on selling to Gentiles foreign servants converted to the
Jewish faith (CD XII, 11). But in addition to these regulations affecting
contacts with non-Jews, a few are concerned with dietary restrictions.


---

## Page 65

Thus:
No man shall defile himself by eating any live creature or creeping thing,
from the larvae of bees to all creatures which creep in water.
(CD XII, 12-13)
Others deal with the laws of purity (CD XII, 16-18) and purification (CD
x, 10-13) and with uncleanness resulting from various sexual
discharges and childbirth (4Q266 fr. 6 i-ii). Outside the Damascus
Document, the B section of MMT (4Q394-5), 4QPurities (4Q274, 276-
7, 284) and the Temple Scroll (11QTS XLV-LI) provide ample
information on purity matters, including the law relative to the burning of
the ‘red heifer’ whose ashes were a necessary ingredient for the
making of the ‘water for (removing) uncleanness’ (MMT 4Q394 3-7 i,
395; 4Q276-7).
Two types of meeting are provided for, with equal laconism: the
‘assembly of the camp’ presided over by a priest or a Levite and the
‘assembly of all the camps’ (CD XIV, 3-6). Presumably the latter was
the general convention of the whole sect held on the Feast of the
Renewal of the Covenant, the annual great festival alluded to in 4QD
(266, 270), when both the ‘men of holiness’ and the ‘men of the
Covenant’ confessed their former errors and committed themselves
once more to perfect obedience to the Law and the sect’s teachings.
According to the available texts, the sectaries were to be mustered
and inscribed in their rank by name, the priests first, the Levites
second, the Israelites third. A fourth group of proselytes is unique to the
‘towns’, but as has been observed these were Gentile slaves
converted to Judaism. A further remark that in this order the sect’s
members were to ‘be questioned on all matters’ leads one to suppose
that the allusion must be to the yearly inquiry into their spiritual
progress mentioned in the Community Rule (CD XIV, 3-6).
Two Cave 4 manuscripts of the Damascus Document describe the
expulsion ceremony of an unfaithful member. He was cursed and
dismissed by the Priest overseeing the Congregation and cursed also
by all the inhabitants of the camps. Should the latter maintain contact


---

## Page 66

with the renegade, they would forfeit their own membership of the sect
(4Q266 fr. 11 ii; 270 fr. 7 i-ii).
Apart from these familiar directions, we learn only that the priest who
mustered the gathering was to be between thirty and sixty years old
and, needless to say, ‘learned in the Book of Meditation’. The
‘Guardian of all the camps’, in his turn, was to be between thirty and
fifty, and to have ‘mastered all the secrets of men and the language of
all their clans’. He was to decide who was to be admitted, and anything
connected with a ‘suit or judgement’ was to be brought to him (CD XIV,
7-12).
As for the initiation of new members, the Statutes appear to
legislate for young men reaching their majority within the brotherhood
and for recruits from outside. This is not entirely clear, but the
instruction that an aspirant was not to be informed of the sect’s rules
until he had stood before the Guardian can hardly have applied to a
person brought up within its close circle (CD xv, 5-6, 10-11).
Of the sect’s own young men the Damascus Document writes
merely:
And all those who have entered the Covenant, granted to all Israel for
ever, shall make their children who have reached the age of enrolment,
swear with the oath of the Covenant.
(CD xv, 5-6)
The Messianic Rule is more discursive. There, enrolment into the sect
is represented as the climax of a childhood and youth spent in study.
Teaching of the Bible and in the ‘precepts of the Covenant’ began long
before the age of ten, at which age a boy embarked on a further ten
years of instruction in the statutes. It was not until after all this that he
was finally ready.
From [his] youth they shall instruct him in the Book of Meditation and shall
teach him, according to his age, the precepts of the Covenant. They [shall
be edu]cated in their statutes for ten years ... At the age of twenty years [he
shall be] enrolled, that he may enter upon his allotted duties in the midst
of his family (and) be joined to the holy congregation.
(IQSa 1, 6-9)


---

## Page 67

The newcomer from outside who repented of his ‘corrupted way’ was
to be enrolled ‘with the oath of the Covenant’ on the day that he spoke
to the Guardian, but no sectarian statute was to be divulged to him ‘lest
when examining him the Guardian be deceived by him’ (CD xv, 7-11).
Nevertheless, if he broke that oath, ‘retribution’ would be exacted of
him. The text subsequently becomes fragmentary and unreliable, but
he is told where to find the liturgical calendar which his oath obliges
him to follow.
As for the exact determination of their times to which
Israel turns a blind eye, behold it is strictly defined in the
Book of the Divisions of the Times into their Jubilees and
Weeks.
(CD XVI, 2-4)
It should be added here that one big difference between the
organization of the brethren in the towns and those of the ‘monastic’
settlement is that new members were not required to surrender their
property. There was none of the voluntary communism found at
Qumran. On the other hand, where the desert sectaries practised
common ownership, those of the towns contributed to the assistance
of their fellows in need. Every man able to do so was ordered to hand
over a minimum of two days’ wages a month to a charitable fund, and
from it the Guardian and the judges distributed help to the orphans, the
poor, the old and sick, to unmarried women without support and to
prisoners held in foreign hands and in need of redemption (CD XIV,
12-16).
When the two varieties of sectarian life are compared, we find many
similarities, especially since the fragments of 4QD and 4Q265 have
become accessible, but some of the differences still remain striking. In
the desert of Qumran men lived together in seclusion; in the towns they
were grouped in families, surrounded by non-members with whom they
were in inevitable though exiguous contact. The desert brotherhood
was to keep apart from the Temple in Jerusalem until the restoration of


---

## Page 68

the true cult in the seventh year of the eschatological war; the town
sectaries participated in worship there. The judges of the towns had no
counterparts at Qumran. The Qumran Guardian was supported by a
Council; the town Guardians acted independently. Unfaithful desert
sectaries were sentenced to irrevocable excommunication, or to
temporary exclusion from the common life, or to suffer lighter
penances; the penal code concerned with the towns envisages also
the death penalty (whether actually executed or not) as well as
corrective custody. The common table and the ‘purity’ associated with
it played an essential role at Qumran; in connection with the towns the
common meal, but not the pure food, goes unmentioned. Furthermore,
at Qumran all the new recruits came from outside; in the towns, some
were converts but others were the sons of sectaries. The desert
novices underwent two years of training and were instructed in the
doctrine of the ‘two spirits’; the towns’ converts were subjected to
neither experience. In the desert, property was owned in common; in
the towns, it was not. And last but not least, the desert community
appears to have practised celibacy, whereas the town sectaries
patently did not.
Yet despite the dissimilarities, at the basic level of doctrine, aims
and principles, a perceptible bond links the brethren of the desert with
those of the towns. They both claim to represent the true Israel. They
both are led by priests, Zadokite priests according to 1QS, the
Damascus Document and the Messianic Rule, but not 4QSb(=4Q256),
4QSd (=4Q258) and MMT.68 Both form units of Thousands, Hundreds,
Fifties and Tens, both insist on a wholehearted return to the Mosaic
Law in accordance with their own particular interpretation of it. They
are both governed by priests (or Levites). The principal superior,
teacher and administrator of both is known by the unusual title of
mebaqqer. In both cases, initiation into the sect is preceded by entry
into the Covenant, sworn by oath. Both groups convene yearly to
review the order of precedence of their members after an inquiry into
the conduct of each man during the previous twelve months. Above all,
both embrace the same ‘unorthodox’ liturgical calendar that sets them
apart from the rest of Jewry.
There can be only one logical conclusion: this was a single religious


---

## Page 69

movement with two branches. It does not, however, answer all our
questions. It does not tell us in particular whether the differentiation
resulted from a relaxation or from a hardening of the original ascetic
rules. Neither are we told whether the sectaries of desert and towns
maintained regular contact among themselves. After all, the history of
religions furnishes scores of examples of sister sects which turned into
mortal enemies. Did the Qumran and towns fellowships profess and
practise unity? A few vital clues suggest that they did.
One indication of a living relationship between the two groups
derives from the Qumran library itself. In it were discovered no less
than ten copies of the Damascus Document and other writings
reflecting the same form of life. It seems hardly likely that they would
have figured so prominently among the Qumran literary treasures if
they had been the rule books of some rival institution. Besides, there
was no trace of any other book in the caves relating to an opposing
religious faction except perhaps in the shape of rebuttal in MMT.
Another pointer towards unity appears in the passage of the
Damascus Document outlining the procedure for the ‘assembly of all
the camps’ and prescribing that the members were to be ‘inscribed by
name’ in hierarchical rank. This clause corresponds exactly to the
statute in the Community Rule ordaining a yearly ranking of the
sectaries (IQS 11, 19-23), with a solemn ritual for the Renewal of the
Covenant (for an analysis of the rite, see pp. 80-81). This leads us to
suppose that the Feast of the Covenant, when the desert brethren held
their annual spiritual survey, was also the occasion for that of the
towns. Can we go further still and establish that the two ceremonies
took place, not only at the same time, but at the same place? In effect,
the literary and archaeological evidence tends to support the theory
that the ‘assembly of all the camps’, identical with the yearly assembly
of the Qumran branch, gathered at Qumran.
The first clue turns on the qualifications of the mebaqqer of the
Community Rule and the Damascus Document respectively. As may
be remembered, the superior at Qumran was required to be expert in
recognizing ‘the nature of all the children of men according to the kind
of spirit which they possess’ (IQS 111, 13-14), while the mebaqqer of
the towns was to be concerned rather more with a man’s ‘deeds’,


---

## Page 70

‘possessions’, ‘ability’, etc., than with his inner spirit. When, however,
the Damascus Document describes the attributes needed of the
‘Guardian of all the camps’, what do we find but a reformulation of
those accredited to the superior of the desert community, that he
should know ‘all the secrets of men and all the languages of their
clans’? It would emerge from this, therefore, that the Guardian of all the
camps and the Guardian at Qumran were one and the same person.
The next hint comes from the fact that the Damascus Document is
directed to both desert and town sectaries. As an example, the
passage from the Exhortation advising men to choose whatever is
pleasing to God and to reject whatever he hates, ‘that you may walk
perfectly in all His ways and not follow after thoughts of the guilty
inclination and after eyes of lust’ (CD 11, 15-16), seems to be
addressed to celibates. Yet in this very same document we later come
upon injunctions aimed explicitly at non-celibates:
And if they live in camps according to the rule of the Land, marrying and
begetting children, they shall walk according to the Law and according to
the statute concerning binding vows, according to the rule of the Law
which says, Between a man and his wife and between a father and his son
(Num. XXX, 17).
(CD VII, 6-9)
The Exhortation would seem in short to be a sermon intended for
delivery on a certain occasion to married and unmarried members of
the sect; and as its theme is perseverance in the Covenant, the
appropriate setting would be the Feast of the Renewal of the Covenant
in the third month (4Q266 fr. II; 270 fr. 7 i-ii), i.e. the Feast of Weeks or
Pentecost (see below, pp. 79-80), and the venue, Qumran.
These literary pointers are supported by two archaeological finds.
Firstly, the twenty-six deposits of animal bones buried on the Qumran
site - goats, sheep, lambs, calves, cows or oxen - have for long
intrigued scholars. Can J. T. Milik be correct in identifying them as the
remains of meals served to large groups of pilgrims in the Qumran
mother-house of the sect (Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness
of Judaea, p. 117)? Naturally, he too connects the gathering with the


---

## Page 71

Covenant festival.
The second archaeological clue also is concerned with bones. The
skeletons of four women and one child, and possibly of two further
female bodies and those of two children, were found in the extension
of the Qumran cemetery. Now, if the Renewal of the Covenant was
attended by sectaries from the towns and their families, this may well
account for the presence of dead women and children among the
otherwise male skeletons of the graveyard proper.
Drawing the threads of these various arguments together, there
would seem to be little doubt not only that the desert and town
sectaries were united in doctrine and organization, but that they
remained in actual and regular touch with each other, under the
ultimate administrative and spiritual authority of the shadowy figure of
the Priest, of whom we hear so little, and his dominant partner, the
Qumran Guardian, Guardian of all the camps. Qumran, it seems, was
the seat of the sect’s hierarchy and also the centre to which all those
turned who professed allegiance to the Council of the Covenant.
APPENDIX: THE ESSENES AND THE QUMRAN
COMMUNITY
The Essenes
Prior to Qumran, the primary sources concerning the Essenes, a
Jewish religious community flourishing during the last two centuries of
the Second Temple era (c. 150 BCE-70 CE), were furnished by the
Greek writings of two Jewish authors, Philo of Alexandria (That Every
Good Man Should be Free, 75-91; Apology for the Jews, quoted in
Eusebius, Praeparatio evangelica VIII, 6-7) and Flavius Josephus
(War 11, 119-61; Antiquities XVIII, 18-22), and by the Roman
geographer and naturalist, Pliny the Elder, who left a short but very
important notice in Latin (Natural History v, 17, 4[73]). For a more
detailed account, see Geza Vermes and Martin Goodman, The


---

## Page 72

Essenes According to the Classical Sources (Sheffield, 1989).
Despite the apparent importance attributed to it by Philo, Josephus
and Pliny, the sect is not explicitly mentioned either in the New
Testament or in rabbinic literature. There is no general agreement
regarding the meaning of the group’s name: Essaioi or Essenoi in
Greek, and Esseni in Latin. The designation may signify ‘the Pious’, or
‘the Healers’, devoted to the cure of body and soul. If the latter
interpretation is adopted, it provides a parallel to the Greek
Therapeutai, the title given by Philo to an Egyptian-Jewish ascetic
society akin to the Essenes (cf. HJP 11, 593-7; Vermes-Goodman,
The Essenes ... , 15-17). There are a number of other, less well-
established, explanations.
The membership of the Palestinian group exceeded four thousand.
Josephus and Philo locate them in Judaean towns; Pliny refers only to
a single Essene settlement in the wilderness between Jericho and
Engedi.
Individual congregations, directed by superiors, resided in
commonly occupied houses. Initiation consisted of one year of
probation, and two years of further training, leading to full table-
fellowship on swearing an oath of loyalty to the sect. Only adult men
qualified according to Philo and Pliny, but Josephus reports that boys
were also trained by them. Serious disobedience resulted in expulsion
from the order.
One of the principal characteristics of the Essenes was common
ownership of property. New members handed over their belongings to
the superiors, who collected also the wages earned by every sectary.
Agriculture was the main Essene occupation. Having renounced
private possessions, the members received all that they needed: food,
clothes, care. Further peculiarities included the wearing of white
garments; ritual bathing before meals which were given only to
initiates, and cooked and blessed by priests; the rejection of animal
sacrifice and of oaths to support their statements, and, above all, of
marriage. Josephus, however, admits that one Essene branch
adopted the married state as long as sex was used only for the
purpose of procreation.
Theologically, they showed extreme reverence for the Law and were


---

## Page 73

famous for their strictest observance of the Sabbath. Their esoteric
teachings were recorded in secret books. Experts in the healing of
body and soul, they also excelled in prophecy. They preferred belief in
Fate to freedom of the will and, rejecting the notion of bodily
resurrection, envisaged a purely spiritual afterlife.
Essenes and Qumran
The common opinion identifying or closely associating the Qumran
sectaries with the Essenes is based on three principal considerations.
1. There is no better site than Qumran to correspond to Pliny’s
settlement between Jericho and Engedi.
2. Chronologically, Essene activity placed by Josephus in the
period between Jonathan Maccabaeus (c. 150 BCE) and the
first Jewish war (66-70 CE) and the sectarian occupation of the
Qumran site coincide perfectly.
3. The similarities of common life, organization and customs are
so fundamental as to render the identification of the two bodies
extremely probable as long as some obvious differences can
be explained.
A good many contradictions appear in the diverse sources and are not
simply due to a lack of harmony between the Scrolls and the Graeco-
Latin documents. Thus Qumran attests both communism and private
property; married and unmarried states. Likewise, Josephus speaks
of celibate and married Essenes and, as has been noted (p. 38
above), the prohibition to ‘fornicate’ with one’s wife remarkably echoes
the married Essenes’ ban on marital sex when the woman was not in a
state to conceive. 69 Furthermore, the Qumran movement incorporated
two separate branches and the manuscripts reflect an organizational
and doctrinal development of some two centuries. It would be
unreasonable to expect complete agreement among the sources. It
must finally be borne in mind that the sectarian compositions were
written by initiates for insiders, whereas Pliny and Philo, and to some
extent even Josephus (although he claims to have undergone a partial


---

## Page 74

Essene education), are bound to have reproduced hearsay evidence,
unlikely to echo fully the views and beliefs prevalent among members.
Hence the identification of Essenism and the Qumran sect remains in
my view the likeliest of all proposed solutions.

III. The History of the Community
The absence from the Dead Sea Scrolls of historical texts proper
should not surprise us. Neither in the inter-Testamental period, nor in
earlier biblical times, was the recording of history as we understand it
a strong point among the Jews. Chroniclers are concerned not with
factual information about bygone events, but with their religious
significance. In Scripture, the ‘secular’ past is viewed and interpreted
by the prophets as revealing God’s pleasure or displeasure. Victory or
defeat in war, peace or social unrest, abundance of harvest or famine,
serve to demonstrate the virtue or sinfulness of the nation and to
forecast its future destiny. And when prophecy declined in the fifth
century BCE, it was still not succeeded by a growth of historiography:
only the memoirs of Ezra and Nehemiah and the retelling of the age-
old stories of the kings of Israel and Judah in the Books of Chronicles
belong to the historical genre. It was followed instead by
eschatological speculation, by apocalyptic visions of the end of time,
with their awe-inspiring beasts and battles, and by announcements of
the ultimate triumph of truth and justice in a future Kingdom of God.
In the Scrolls, the apocalyptic compositions form part of this later
tradition. On the other hand, apart from occasional snippets in a
liturgical calendar (4Q322, 324), an odd poem alluding to ‘King’
Jonathan (4Q448), and deductive conclusions made from the
comparative study of rules, most of the knowledge we possess of the
sect’s history originates from works of Bible interpretation. The
Qumran writers, while meditating on the words of the Old Testament
prophets, sought to discover in them allusions to their own past,
present and future. Convinced that they were living in the last days,
they read the happenings of their times as the fulfilment of biblical
predictions.
Yet all that these non-historical sources provide are fragments. Even
with the help of the archaeological data from Qumran they cannot be
made into a consistent and continuous narrative. For an understanding

of the sect’s past as it developed within the larger framework of late
Second Temple Jewish history, we have to rely principally on Flavius
Josephus, the Palestinian Jew who became a Greek man of letters,
and on other Jewish Hellenists, such as the authors of the Books of the
Maccabees, and Philo of Alexandria, all of whom inherited the Greek
predilection for recording and interpreting the past and set out to
depict the life of the Jews of Palestine in itself, and as part of the
Graeco-Roman world, from the early second century BCE to the first
anti-Roman war in 66-70 CE. It is only with the help of the wider canvas
painted by these ancient writers that places can be found for the often
cryptic historical allusions contained in the Scrolls.
1 INTER-TESTAMENTAL JEWISH HISTORY: 200
BCE-70 CE
At the beginning of the second century BCE, Palestinian Jewry passed
through a state of crisis. Alexander the Great had conquered the Holy
Land in 332 BCE and, after the early uncertainties which followed his
death, it became part of the empire of the Greeks of Egypt, known as
the Ptolemies. During the third century, the Ptolemies avoided, as
much as possible, interfering with the internal life of the Jewish nation
and, while taxes were required to be paid, it remained under the rule of
the High Priest and his council. Important changes in the patterns of
population nevertheless took place during this time. Hellenistic cities
were built along the Mediterranean coast, such as Gaza, Ascalon
(Ashkelon), Joppa (Jaffa), Dor and Acco, re-named Ptolemais. Inland
also, to the south of the Lake of Tiberias, the ancient town of Beth
Shean was reborn as the Greek city of Scythopolis; Samaria, the
capital city of the Samaritans, was Hellenized as Sebaste; and in
Transjordan, Rabbath-Ammon (Amman) was re-founded as
Philadelphia. In other words, Greeks, Macedonians and Hellenized
Phoenicians took up permanent residence on Palestinian soil and the
further spread of Greek civilization and culture was merely a matter of
time.

With the conquest of the Holy Land by the Seleucids, or Syrian
Greeks, in 200 BCE, the first signs appeared of Jews succumbing to a
foreign cultural influence. In the apocryphal Book of Ecclesiasticus,
dated to the beginning of the second century BCE, its author, Jesus
ben Sira, a sage from Jerusalem, rages against those ‘ungodly men’
who have ‘forsaken the Law of the Most High God’ (xli, 8). But the real
trouble started when Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 BCE) officially
promoted a Hellenizing programme in Judaea that was embraced with
eagerness by the Jewish elite. The leader of the modernist faction was
the brother of the High Priest Onias III. Known as Jesus among his
compatriots, he adopted the Greek name of Jason, and set about
transforming Jerusalem into a Hellenistic city, by building a gymnasium
there and persuading the Jewish youth to participate in athletic games.
As 2 Maccabees describes the situation:
So Hellenism reached a high point with the introduction of foreign
customs through the boundless wickedness of the impious Jason, no
true High Priest. As a result, the priests no longer had any enthusiasm for
their duties at the altar, but despised the temple and neglected the
sacrifices; and in defiance of the law they eagerly contributed to the
expenses of the wrestling-school whenever the opening gong called
them. They placed no value on their hereditary dignities, but cared above
everything for Hellenic honours.
(2 Mac. iv, 13-15)
Jason was succeeded by two other High Priests with the same Greek
sympathies, Menelaus and Alcimus. In 169 BCE Antiochus IV visited
Jerusalem and looted the Temple. But when in 167 he actually
prohibited the practice of Judaism under pain of death and
rededicated the Jerusalem Sanctuary to Olympian Zeus, the
‘abomination of desolation’, the opponents of the Hellenizers finally
rose up in violent resistance. An armed revolt was instigated by the
priest Mattathias and his sons the Maccabee brothers, supported by
all the traditionalist Jews, and in particular by the company of the
Pious, the Asidaeans or Hasidim, ‘stalwarts of Israel, every one of
them a volunteer in the cause of the Law’ (1 Mac. ii, 42-3). Led by
Judas Maccabaeus and, after his death on the battlefield, by his


---

## Page 78

brothers Jonathan and Simon, the fierce defenders of Judaism were
able not only to restore Jewish worship in Jerusalem, but against all
expectations even managed to eject the ruling Seleucids and to
liberate Judaea.
The Maccabaean triumph was, however, not simply a
straightforward victory of godliness and justice over idolatry and
tyranny; it was accompanied by serious social and religious
upheavals. There was firstly a change in the pontifical succession. With
the murder in 171 BCE of Onias III and the deposition of the usurper,
his brother Jason, the Zadokite family, from which the incumbents of
the High Priest’s office traditionally came, lost the monopoly which it
had held for centuries. Furthermore, when Onias IV, the son of Onias III,
was prevented from taking over the High Priesthood from Menelaus,
he emigrated to Egypt and in direct breach of biblical law, which
authorizes only a single sanctuary in Jerusalem, erected a Jewish
temple in Leontopolis with the blessing of King Ptolemy Philometor
(182-146 BCE). His inauguration of Israelite worship outside Zion, with
the connivance of some priests and Levites, must have scandalized
every Palestinian conservative, especially other priests who belonged,
or were allied, to the Zadokite dynasty.
There was trouble also within the ranks of the Maccabees
themselves. The Hasidim - or part of their group - defected when
Alcimus, whom they trusted, was appointed High Priest in 162 BCE.
This move on their part turned out to be naïve ; Alcimus’ Syrian allies
massacred sixty of them in one day (1 Mac. vii, 2-20).
Lastly, a major political change came about when Jonathan
Maccabaeus, himself a priest but not a Zadokite, accepted in 153-152
BCE pontifical office from Alexander Balas, a usurper of the Seleucid
throne. Alexander was anxious for Jewish support and was not
mistaken in thinking that an offer of the High Priesthood would be
irresistible. For the conservatives this was an illegal seizure of power.
But they were even more scandalized by the appointment in 140 BCE,
following Jonathan’s execution in 143- 142 by the Syrian general
Tryphon, of Simon Maccabee as High Priest and hereditary leader of
the people by means of a decree passed by a Jewish national
assembly.

From then on, until Pompey’s transformation of the independent
Jewish state into a Roman province in 63 BCE, Judaea was ruled by a
new dynasty of High Priests, later Priest-Kings, known as the
Hasmonaeans after the grandfather of the Maccabees, Hasmon, or
Asamonaeus according to Josephus (War 1, 36). During the
intervening years, all Simon’s successors, but especially John
Hyrcanus I (134-104 BCE) and Alexander Jannaeus (103-76 BCE), for
whom their political role took precedence over their office of High
Priest, occupied one by one the Hellenistic cities of Palestine and
conquered the neighbouring territories of Idumaea in the south,
Samaria in the centre and Ituraea in the north.
Throughout this period of territorial expansion, the Hasmonaean
rulers enjoyed the support of the Sadducees, one of the three religious
parties first mentioned under Jonathan Maccabaeus (cf. Josephus,
Antiquities XIII, 171) and regular allies of the government. They were
opposed by the Pharisees, an essentially lay group formed from one of
the branches of the Hasidim of the Maccabaean age. Already in the
days of John Hyrcanus I there was Pharisaic objection to his
usurpation of the High Priesthood, though they were willing to
recognize him as national leader (Antiquities XIII, z 88-98), but on one
other occasion, at least, their opposition was overcome by force.
Accused of plotting against Alexander Jannaeus in 88 BCE in
collusion with the Syrian Seleucid king Demetrius III Eucaerus, 800
Pharisees were condemned by Jannaeus to die on the cross
(Antiquities xm, 380-83; War 1, 96-8).
After Pompey’s seizure of Jerusalem, the Hasmonaean High
Priesthood continued for another three decades, but the political
power formerly belonging to them passed to the Judaized Idumaean,
Herod the Great, when he was promoted to the throne of Jerusalem by
Rome in 37 BCE. It is to the last year or two of his reign - he died in 4
BCE - that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke date the birth of Jesus of
Nazareth (Matth. ii, 1; Lk. i, 5).
After the ephemeral rule of the successor to Herod the Great, Herod
Archelaus (4 BCE-6 CE), who was deposed by Augustus for his
misgovernment of Jews and Samaritans alike, Galilee continued in
semi-autonomy under the Herodian princes Antipas (4 BCE-39 CE)

and Agrippa (39-41 CE), but Judaea was placed under the direct
administration of Roman authority. In 6 CE, Coponius, the first Roman
prefect of Judaea, arrived to take up his duties there. This prefectorial
regime, whose most notorious representative was Pontius Pilate (26-
36 CE), lasted for thirty-five years until 41, when the emperor Claudius
appointed Agrippa I as king. He died, however, three years later, and
in 44 CE the government of the province once more reverted to
Roman officials, this time with the title of procurator. Their corrupt and
unwise handling of Jewish affairs was one of the chief causes of the
war of 66 which led to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, and to
the subsequent decline of the Sadducees, the extinction of the Zealots
in Masada in 74, the disappearance of the Essenes, and the survival
and uncontested domination of the Pharisees and their rabbinic
successors.
It is into this general course of events that the history of Qumran has
to be inserted. Document by document the Scrolls will be scrutinized
and the literary information combined, both with the findings of Qumran
archaeology and with the incidental reports provided by Josephus. In
the end it is hoped that the history of the Essene sect will begin to fall
reliably into place.
2 THE HISTORY OF THE ESSENES
(a) Concealed References in the Scrolls
The search for clues to the origins and story of the movement begins
with the Damascus Document because it is a writing particularly rich in
such hints. Here, the birth of the Community is said to have occurred in
the ‘age of wrath’, 390 years after the destruction of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. At that time, a ‘root’ sprung ‘from
Israel and Aaron’, i.e. a group of pious Jews, laymen and priests,
came into being in a situation of general ungodliness. These people
‘groped for the way’ for twenty years, and then God sent them a


---

## Page 81

‘Teacher of Righteousness’ to guide them ‘in the way of His heart’ (1,
5-11). The Teacher did not meet with unanimous approval within the
congregation, and a faction described as ‘seekers of smooth things’,
‘removers of the bounds’ and ‘builders of the wall’, all metaphors
seeming to point to religious laxity and infidelity, turned against him
and his followers. The leader of the breakaway party, though accorded
a number of unflattering sobriquets, such as ‘Scoffer’, ‘Liar’ or ‘Spouter
of Lies’, seems to be one and the same person. His associates erred
in matters of ritual cleanness, justice, chastity, the dates of festivals
and Temple worship; they were lovers of money and enemies of
peace. In the ensuing fratricidal struggle, the Teacher and those who
remained faithful to him went into exile in the ‘land of Damascus’ where
they entered into a ‘new Covenant’. There, the Teacher of
Righteousness was ‘gathered in’, meaning that he died. In the
meantime, the wicked dominated over Jerusalem and the Temple,
though not without experiencing God’s vengeance at the hands of the
‘Chief of the Kings of Greece’.
A similar picture emerges from the Habakkuk Commentary with its
explicit mention of desertion by disciples of the Teacher of
Righteousness to the Liar, and also by members unfaithful to the ‘new
Covenant’. The allusions to the protagonists of the conflict are sharper
in this work than in the Damascus Document. We learn that the villain,
known in this Scroll as the ‘Wicked Priest’ as well as the ‘Liar’ and
‘Spouter of Lies’, was ‘called by the name of truth’ before he became
Israel’s ruler and was corrupted by wealth and power (VIII, 8-11) - the
implication being that for a time he had met with the sect’s approval.
Subsequently, however, he defiled Jerusalem and the Temple. He also
sinned against the Teacher of Righteousness and his disciples,
chastising him while the ‘House of Absalom’ looked silently on (v, 9-
12), and confronting him in his place of exile on the sect’s Day of
Atonement (xi, 6-8). He ‘vilified and outraged the elect of God’, ‘plotted
to destroy the Poor’, i.e. the Community, and stole their riches. As a
punishment, God delivered him ‘into the hand of his enemies’, who
‘took vengeance on his body of flesh’ (IX, 2). At the last judgement,
predicts the Commentary, the Wicked Priest will empty ‘the cup of
wrath of God’. His successors, the ‘last Priests of Jerusalem’, are also


---

## Page 82

charged with amassing ‘money and wealth by plundering the peoples’,
i.e. foreigners. But, so the commentator asserts, all their riches and
booty will be snatched from them by the Kittim, the conquerors of the
world commissioned by God to pay them their just deserts.
Because of lacunae, one cannot be quite sure from the Habakkuk
Commentary that the Teacher was a priest. The Commentary on
Psalms (Ps. xxxvii, 4Q171, 173), by contrast, makes this plain.
Interpreting verses 23-4, it reads: ‘this concerns the Priest, the
Teacher of [Righteousness]’. It further supplies a significant detail by
assigning to ‘the violent of the nations’, that is to say to the Gentiles as
opposed to the Jews, the execution of judgement on the Wicked
Priest. Another point of interest is that the enemies of the sect are
alluded to as ‘the wicked of Ephraim and Manasseh’, i.e. as of two
distinct factions. They appear also in the Commentary on Nahum.
In the Messianic Anthology or Testimonia (4Q175), references
appear in the final section, borrowed from a Joshua Apocryphon or
Psalms of Joshua (4Q379 fr. 22 ii), to two ‘instruments of violence’
who ruled Jerusalem. They are cursed for making the city a ‘stronghold
of ungodliness’ and for committing ‘an abomination’ in the land. They
are also said to have shed blood ‘like water on the ramparts of the
daughter of Zion’. The relationship of the two tyrants to one another
cannot be established with certainty because of the fragmentary nature
of the manuscript. They could be father and son. On the other hand, the
expression ‘instruments of violence’ depends on Genesis xlix, 5 where
it describes the brother murderers, Simeon and Levi, the destroyers of
Shechem.
The Nahum Commentary moves on to an age following that of the
Teacher of Righteousness and the Wicked Priest, as neither of them is
mentioned. The principal character here is the ‘furious young lion’, a
Jewish ruler of Jerusalem. He is said to have taken revenge on the
‘seekers of smooth things’, whom he reproached for having invited
‘Demetrius’ the king of Greece to Jerusalem. The attempt failed; no
foreigner entered the city ‘from the time of Antiochus until the coming
of the rulers of the Kittim’. The enemies of the ‘furious young lion’ were
‘hanged alive on the tree’, a familiar Hebrew circumlocution for
crucifixion. As in the Commentary on Psalm xxxvii, the sobriquets


---

## Page 83

‘Ephraim’ and ‘Manasseh’ are attached to the Community’s
opponents. ‘Ephraim’ is said to ‘walk in lies and falsehood’, but
because of gaps in the manuscript, the description of ‘Manasseh’ is
less clear. It seems nevertheless that this party included ‘great men’,
‘mighty men’ and ‘men of dignity’.
The Nahum Commentary was the first of the Qumran Scrolls to
disclose historical names: those of two Seleucid kings, Antiochus and
Demetrius. But their identity has still to be determined because nine
monarchs in all bore the first name, and three the second. Additional
names figure in various Cave 4 manuscripts of a liturgical calendar
(4Q331-3): ‘Shelamzion’, the Hebrew name of Queen Salome-
Alexandra, widow of Alexander Jannaeus, who reigned from 76 to 67
BCE; ‘Hyrcanus’ and ‘John’, probably John Hyrcanus II, son of
Alexandra and High Priest from 76 to 67 and again from 63 to 40; and
‘Emilius’, no doubt M. Aemilius Scaurus, the first Roman governor of
Syria from 65 to 62 BCE, who is charged with killing people. Note also
that the Balakros of 4Q243 may be the Seleucid usurper Alexander
Balas.
A remarkable piece of prayer-poetry (4Q448) refers to ‘King
Jonathan’ in connection with Jerusalem and diaspora Jewry. A good
case has been made out by E. and H. Eshel (IEJ 42, 1992, 199-229)
for identifying him with Alexander Jannaeus, but in my opinion an even
stronger argument points towards Jonathan Maccabaeus as ‘King
Jonathan’ (cf. JJS44, 1993, 294-300). Also, one of the proposed
readings of line 9 of the List of False Prophets (4Q339), ‘[John son of
Sim]on’, would provide an allusion to John Hyrcanus I. Finally, the
person called Potlaos - Ptollas - Peitholaos (4Q468e) may refer to one
of two historical figures who lived either in the middle or the end of the
first century BCE.
In the Commentaries on Habakkuk and Nahum, the Kittim are
represented as instruments appointed by God to punish the ungodly
priests of Jerusalem. The War Rule, however, testifies to a changed
attitude towards them on the part of the sect by making the Kittim
appear as the chief allies of Belial or Satan and the final foe to be
subjugated by the hosts of the sons of Light. The Rule of War (4Q285),
although very fragmentary, appears to point in the same direction.

## Page 84

Several Qumran Hymns reflect the career and sentiments of a
teacher, possibly of the Teacher of Righteousness himself. According
to them, he was opposed by ‘interpreters of error’, ‘traitors’,
‘deceivers’, and ‘those who seek smooth things’, all of whom were
formerly his ‘friends’ and ‘members of [his] Covenant’, bearers of the
‘yoke of [his] testimony’. In one of them, the reference to a ‘devilish
scheme’ is reminiscent of the allusion in the Habakkuk Commentary to
the visit of the Wicked Priest to the Community’s place of exile in order
to cause them ‘to stumble’:
Teachers of lies [have smoothed] Thy people [with words],
and [false prophets] have led them astray...
They have banished me from my land like a bird from its nest...
And they, teachers of lies and seers of falsehood,
have schemed against me a devilish scheme,
to exchange the Law engraved on my heart by Thee
for the smooth things (which they speak) to Thy people.
And they withhold from the thirsty the drink of Knowledge,
and assuage their thirst with vinegar,
that they may gaze on their straying,
on their folly concerning their feast-days,
on their fall into the snares.
(IQH XII [formerly IV], 7-12)
Another Hymn appears to hint at the Teacher’s withdrawal from society
and to announce with confidence his eventual glorious justification:
For Thou, O God, hast sheltered me
from the children of men,
and hast hidden Thy Law [within me]
against the time when Thou shouldst reveal
Thy salvation to me.
(IQH XIII [formerly V], 11-12)
Some scholars consider these poems autobiographical, i.e. written by
the Teacher, but this is mere speculation.
It would be unrealistic, taking into account the vagueness of all these
statements, the cryptic nature of the symbolism and the entire lack of
any systematic exposition of the sect’s history, to expect every detail to


---

## Page 85

be identified. We can, however, attempt to define the chronological
framework of the historical references and thus be in a position to
place at least some of the key events and principal personalities within
the context of Jewish history as we know it.
(b) The Chronological Framework
The chronological setting of Qumran history may be reconstructed from
archaeological and literary evidence. The excavations of 1951-6 date
the beginning, the terminus a quo, of the sectarian establishment to
150-140 BCE and its end, the terminus ad quem, to the middle of the
first war against Rome, 68 CE.70 The literary allusions, particularly the
identifiable historical names, confirm this general finding. It goes
without saying, however, that the initial phases of the Community’s
existence must have preceded by some years or decades the actual
establishment of the sect at Qumran. The first task therefore is to
examine the Scrolls for indications of its origins. The Nahum
Commentary implies that a king by the name of Antiochus was alive at
the beginning of the period with which the documents are concerned.
This Antiochus, although one among several so called, can only have
been Antiochus IV Epiphanes, notorious for his looting of Jerusalem
and the profanation of the Temple in 169-168 BCE.
More significant as a chronological pointer is the dating, in the
Damascus Document, of the sect’s beginnings to the ‘age of wrath’,
390 years after the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in 586
BCE. This should bring us to 196 BCE but, as is well known, Jewish
historians are not very reliable in their time-reckoning for the post-exilic
era. They do not seem to have had a clear idea of the length of the
Persian domination, and they were in addition not free of the
theological influence of the Book of Daniel, where a period of seventy
weeks of years, i.e. 490 years, is given as separating the epoch of
Nebuchadnezzar from that of the Messiah. As it happens, if to this
figure of 390 years is added, firstly twenty (during which the ancestors
of the Community ‘groped’ for their way until the entry on the scene of


---

## Page 86

the Teacher of Righteousness), then another forty (the time span
between the death of the Teacher and the dawn of the messianic
epoch), the total stretch of years arrived at is 450. And if to this total is
added the duration of the Teacher’s ministry of, say, forty years - a
customary round figure—the final result is the classic seventy times
seven years.
Yet even if the literal figure of 390 is rejected, there are still
compelling reasons for placing the ‘age of wrath’ in the opening
decades of the second pre-Christian century. Only the Hellenistic crisis
which occurred at that time, and which is recalled in various Jewish
literary sources from the last two centuries BCE, provides a fitting
context for the historical allusions made in the sectarian writings (cf.
Daniel ix-xi; Enoch xc, 6-7; Jubilees XXIII, 14-19; Testament of Levi
XVII; Assumption of Moses IV-V). Also, it is the Hasidim of the pre-
Maccabaean and early Maccabaean era who best correspond to the
earlier but unorganized group as it is described there (cf. pp. 51-2).
As for the terminus ad quem of Qumran history, as this is linked to
the appearance of the Kittim, we have to determine who these people
were. In its primitive sense, the word ‘Kittim’ described the inhabitants
of Kition, a Phoenician colony in Cyprus. Later the name tended to be
applied indiscriminately to those living in ‘all islands and most
maritime countries’ (Josephus, Antiquities 1, 128). But from the
second century BCE, Jewish writers also used ‘Kittim’ more precisely
to denote the greatest world power of the day. In Maccabees (i, 1; viii,
5) they are Greeks; Alexander the Great and Perseus are called kings
of the ‘Kittim’. In Daniel xi, 30 on the other hand, the ‘Kittim’ are
Romans; it was the ambassador of the Roman senate, Poppilius
Laenas, brought to Alexandria by ‘ships of Kittim’, i.e. the Roman fleet,
who instructed the ‘king of the North’, the Seleucid monarch Antiochus
Epiphanes, to withdraw at once from Egypt. The term ‘Romans’ is
substituted for ‘Kittim’ already in the old Greek or Septuagint version of
Daniel xi, 30. None of these texts is critical of the ‘Kittim’. They are
seen as the ruling force of the time, but not as hostile to Israel. In fact,
in Daniel they humiliate the enemy of the Jews. It is not till a later stage,
especially after 70 CE, that they come to symbolize oppression and
tyranny.


---

## Page 87

In the Habakkuk Commentary, the portrait of the Kittim is neutral, as
in Maccabees and Daniel. (In the Damascus Document they play no
part; the alien adversary there is the ‘Chief of the Kings of Greece’.)
Feared and admired by all, they are seen to be on the point of
defeating the ‘last Priests of Jerusalem’ and confiscating their wealth,
as they have done to many others before. Such a representation of a
victorious and advancing might would hardly apply to the Greek
Seleucids of Syria, who by the second half of the second century BCE
were in grave decline. But it does correspond to the Romans, whose
thrust to the east in the first century BCE resulted in their triumphs over
Pontus, Armenia and Seleucid Syria, and finally, with the arrival of
Pompey in Jerusalem in 63 BCE, in the transformation of the
Hasmonaean state into Judaea, a province of the Roman republic.
Since the identification of the ‘Kittim’ as Romans is nowadays
generally accepted, it will suffice to cite a single, but very striking,
feature in the Habakkuk Commentary to support it. Interpreting Hab. 1,
14-16 as referring to the ‘Kittim’, the commentator writes: ‘This means
that they sacrifice to their standards and worship their weapons of war’
(IQpHab. VI, 3-5). Now this custom of worshipping the signa was a
characteristic of the religion of the Roman armies both in republican
and in imperial times, as Josephus testifies in his report of the capture
of the Temple of Jerusalem by the legionaries of Titus in 70.
The Romans, now that the rebels had fled to the city, and the Sanctuary
itself and all around it were in flames, carried their standards into the
Temple court, and setting them up opposite the eastern gate, there
sacrificed to them.
(War VI, 3I6)
It is also worth noting that the ‘Kittim’ of the War Scroll, the final
opponents of the eschatological Israel, are subject to a king or
emperor (melekh). Previously, in the Commentaries of Habakkuk and
Nahum, they are said to have been governed by rulers (moshelim). In
sum, therefore, the time-limits of the sect’s history appear to be at one
extreme the beginning of the second century BCE, and at the other
some moment during the Roman imperial epoch, i.e. after 27 BCE.


---

## Page 88

And this latter date is determined by Qumran archaeology as
coinciding with the first Jewish war, and even more precisely with the
arrival of the armies of Vespasian and Titus in the neighbourhood of
the Dead Sea in June 68 CE.

(c) Decipherment of Particular Allusions
The ‘age of wrath’ having been identified as that of the Hellenistic
crisis of the beginning of the second century BCE, the ‘root’ as the
Hasidim of the pre-Maccabaean age, and the ‘Kittim’ as the Romans,
the next major problem is to discover who was, or were, the principal
Jewish enemy or enemies of the sect at the time of the ministry of the
Teacher of Righteousness variously known as the ‘Scoffer’, the ‘Liar’ ,
the ‘Spouter of Lies’ and the ‘Wicked Priest’ (IQpHab, 4QPsa, CD).
It is not unreasonable to conclude that all these insults are directed
at the same individual. It would appear from the Damascus Document
that the ‘Scoffer’ and the ‘Liar’ (cf. also 4QpPsa [XXXVII]) were one
and the same (‘when the Scoffer arose who shed over Israel the
waters of lies’, CD 1, 14). And we read of the ‘Wicked Priest’ that he
was called ‘by the name of truth’ (1QpHab VIII, 8-9) at the outset of his
career, the inference being that later he changed into a ‘Liar’.
Another basic premise must be that the person intended by the
fragments of information contained in the Scrolls became the head, the
national leader, of the Jewish people. For although biblical names are
often used symbolically, including that of ‘Israel’, the actions attributed
to the ‘Wicked Priest’ make little sense if the person in question did
not exercise both pontifical and secular power. He ‘ruled over Israel’.
He ‘robbed... the riches of the men of violence who rebelled against
God’, probably Jewish apostates, as well as ‘the wealth of the
peoples’, i.e. the Gentiles. He built ‘his city of vanity with blood’,
committed ‘abominable deeds in Jerusalem and defiled the Temple of
God’ (1QpHab VIII). Taken separately, these observations might be
understood allegorically, but considered together, they constitute a
strong argument for recognizing the ‘Wicked Priest’ as a ruling High
Priest in Jerusalem.
The ‘Wicked Priest’, then, was a Pontiff who enjoyed good repute
before he assumed office. He was victorious over his adversaries at
home and abroad. He rebuilt Jerusalem (cf. 1QpHab VIII, 8-11;


---

## Page 90

4Q448). And he was eventually captured and put to death by a foreign
rival.
The chronological guidelines established in the preceding section
locate the period in which this individual flourished between the reign
of Antiochus Epiphanes (175-164 BCE) and the probable date of the
foundation at Qumran (150-140 BCE). During that time, five men held
the office of High Priest. Three of them were pro-Greek: Jason,
Menelaus and Alcimus. The remaining two were the Maccabee
brothers, Jonathan and Simon. All the Hellenizers can be eliminated as
candidates for the role of ‘Wicked Priest’ since none can be said to
have enjoyed anything like good repute at the beginning of their
ministry. Jason and Alcimus fail also because neither was killed by an
enemy, as implied in 1QpHab VIII-IX. Jason died in exile (2 Mac. v, 7-
9) and Alcimus in office (1 Mac. ix, 54-6). The Maccabee brothers, by
contrast, meet all the conditions. The careers of both men fall easily
into two stages, marked, in the case of Jonathan, by his acceptance of
the High Priesthood from Alexander Balas, and in the case of Simon
by his willingness to become a hereditary High Priest. Both were also
‘instruments of violence’ and both died by violence. Jonathan is
nevertheless to be chosen rather than Simon because he alone
suffered the vengeance of the ‘Chief of the Kings of Greece’ and died
at the hands of the ‘violent of the nations’, whereas Simon was
murdered by his son-in-law (i Mac. xvi, 14-16). A gallant defender of
Jewish religion and independence, Jonathan succeeded the heroic
Judas in 161 BCE when the latter fell in battle. But he qualified for the
epithet ‘Wicked Priest’ when he accepted in 153-152 BCE from
Alexander Balas, a heathen usurper of the Seleucid throne who had no
right to grant them, the pontifical vestments which Jonathan was not
entitled to wear. Captured later by a former general of Alexander
Balas, Tryphon, he was killed by him at Bascama in Transjordan (1
Mac. xiii, 23).
Concerning the identity of the ‘last Priests of Jerusalem’, the
passion for conquest, wealth and plunder for which they are
reproached points to the Hasmonaean priestly rulers, from Simon’s
son, John Hyrcanus I (134-104 BCE), to Judas Aristobulus II (67-63
BCE). There can in particular be little doubt that the ‘furious young lion’,


---

## Page 91

designated also as ‘the last Priest’ in a badly damaged Commentary
on Hosea (4Q167 11 2-3), was one of them, namely Alexander
Jannaeus. The application to him of the words of Nahum, ‘who chokes
prey for its lionesses’, and the report that the ‘young lion’ executed the
‘seekers of smooth things’ by ‘hanging men alive’, accord perfectly
with the known story that Jannaeus crucified 800 Pharisees whilst
feasting with his concubines (cf. above, p. 53).
From this it follows that ‘Ephraim’, equated in the Commentary on
Nahum with the ‘seekers of smooth things’, symbolizes the Pharisees,
and that if so, ‘Manasseh’ and his dignitaries must refer to the
Sadducees. In other words, the political and doctrinal opponents of the
Essene community, though itself with proto-Sadducaean links on
account of its priestly leadership as insinuated by MMT, were the
Sadducees and the Pharisees.
This division of Jewish society into three opposing groups
corresponds to the conformation described by Josephus as existing
from the time of Jonathan Maccabaeus (Antiquities XIII, 171), but the
new insight provided by the Scrolls suggests that the united resistance
to Hellenism first fell apart when the Maccabees, and more precisely
Jonathan, refused to acknowledge the spiritual leadership of the
Teacher of Righteousness, the priestly head of the Hasidim. From then
on, the sect saw its defectors as ‘Ephraim’ and ‘Manasseh’, these
being the names of the sons of Joseph, associated in biblical history
with the apostate Northern kingdom, and referred to itself as the
‘House of Judah’, the faithful South.
Unfortunately, on the most vital topic of all, the question of the identity
of the Teacher of Righteousness, we can be nothing like as clear. If the
‘Wicked Priest’ was Jonathan Maccabaeus, the Teacher would, of
course, have been one of his contemporaries. Yet all we know of him
is that he was a priest (1QpHab 11, 8; 4QpPs [XXXVII ii, 15=4Q171]),
no doubt of Zadokite affiliation, though obviously opposed to Onias IV
since he did not follow him to Egypt and to his unlawful Temple in
Leontopolis.71 He founded or re-founded the Community. He
transmitted to them his own distinctive interpretation of the Prophets
and, if we can rely at least indirectly on the Hymns, of the laws relating
to the celebration of festivals. The ‘Liar’ and his sympathizers in the


---

## Page 92

congregation of the Hasidim disagreed with him, and after a violent
confrontation between the two factions in which the ‘Liar’ gained the
upper hand, the Teacher and his remaining followers fled to a place of
refuge called ‘the land of Damascus’: it has been suggested that this is
a cryptic designation of Babylonia, the original birthplace of the group,
or else that ‘Damascus’ is a symbolical name for Qumran. The ‘House
of Absalom’ gave the Teacher of Righteousness no help against the
‘Liar’, writes the Habakkuk commentator (1QpHab v, 9-12), the
implication being that this was support on which he might have relied. If
‘Absalom’ is also a symbol, it doubtless recalls the rebellion of
Absalom against his father David, and thus points to the perfidy of a
close relation or intimate friend of the Teacher. On the other hand,
since the ‘House of Absalom’ is accused not of an actual attack but
simply of remaining silent during the Teacher’s ‘chastisement’, this
allegorical solution may not be convincing. The allusion may then be a
straightforward one. A certain Absalom was an ambassador of Judas
Maccabaeus (2 Mac. xi, 17), and his son Mattathias was one of
Jonathan’s gallant officers (1 Mac. xi, 70). Another of his sons,
Jonathan, commanded Simon’s army which captured Joppa (1 Mac.
xiii, 11).
Meanwhile, even in his ‘place of exile’ the Teacher continued to be
harassed and persecuted by the Wicked Priest. In this connection, the
most important and painful episode appears to have been the Priest’s
pursuit of the Teacher to his settlement with the purpose of pouring on
him ‘his venomous fury’. Appearing before the sectaries on ‘their
Sabbath of repose’, at the ‘time appointed for rest, for the Day of
Atonement’, his intention was to cause them ‘to stumble on the Day of
Fasting’. It is impossible to say, from the evidence so far available,
precisely what happened on this portentous occasion, or whether it
was then or later that the Wicked Priest ‘laid hands’ on the Teacher
‘that he might put him to death’. The wording is equivocal. For
example, the verb in 1QpHab xi, 5, 7, translated ‘to confuse’, can also
mean ‘to swallow up’, and some scholars have chosen to understand
that the Teacher was killed by the Wicked Priest at the time of the visit.
On the other hand, we find recounted in the imperfect tense (which can
be rendered into English as either the future or the present tense): ‘The


---

## Page 93

wicked of Ephraim and Manasseh ... seek/will seek to lay hands on the
Priest and the men of his Council... But God redeems/will redeem
them from out of their hand’ (4QpPsa [XXXVII, II, I7-I9=4QI7I]). In other
words, we neither know who the founder of the Essenes was, nor how,
nor where, nor when he died. Only writers upholding the most unlikely
Christian identification of the Community claim to be better informed,
but disagree among themselves. J. L. Teicher thought the Teacher
was Jesus. For Barbara Thiering Jesus was the Wicked Priest, John
the Baptist the Teacher; R. H. Eisenman rejects both and prefers
James the Just, ‘the brother of the Lord’, as the Teacher of
Righteousness. Only the sensation-seeking media have been taken in
by their theories.
It has been suggested that this inability to identify the Teacher of
Righteousness in the context of the Maccabaean period undermines
the credibility of the reconstruction as a whole. Is it conceivable, it is
asked, that a figure of the stature of the Teacher should have left no
trace in the literature relating to that time? The answer to this objection
is that such writings are to all intents and purposes restricted to the
Books of the Maccabees, sources politically biased in favour of their
heroes and virtually oblivious of the very existence of opposition
movements. Josephus himself relies largely on 1 Maccabees and
cannot therefore be regarded as an independent witness. But even
were this not so, and he had additional material at his disposition, his
silence vis-à-vis the Teacher of Righteousness would still not call for
particular comment since he also makes no mention of the founder of
the Pharisees. And incidentally, not a few historians hold that he has
nothing to say either of Jesus of Nazareth. The so-called Testimonium
Flavianum (Antiquities XVIII, 63-4), they maintain, is a Christian
interpolation into the genuine text of Antiquities (though others, myself
included, think that part of the text is authentic). Be this as it may, not a
word is breathed by him about Hillel, the greatest of the Pharisee
masters, or about Yohanan ben Zakkai, who reorganized Judaism
after the destruction of the Temple, although both of these men lived in
Josephus’ own century and Yohanan was definitely his contemporary.
Admittedly, the various fragments of information gleaned from the
Dead Sea Scrolls result in an unavoidably patchy story, but it is


---

## Page 94

fundamentally sound, and the continuing anonymity of the Teacher
does nothing to impair it. For the present synthesis to be complete it
remains now to turn to Josephus for his occasional historical
references to individual Essenes and to Essenism.
To begin with it should be pointed out that four members of the
Community are actually mentioned by the Jewish historian, three of
them associated with prophecy, one of the distinctive interests of the
Teacher of Righteousness himself. The first, called Judas, is
encountered in Jerusalem surrounded by a group of pupils taking
instruction in ‘foretelling the future’, which probably means how to
identify prophetic pointers to future events. Josephus writes of him that
he had ‘never been known to speak falsely in his prophecies’, and that
he predicted the death of Antigonus, the brother of Aristobulus I (104-
103 BCE) (Antiquities XIII, 311-13). A second Essene prophet,
Menahem, apparently foretold that Herod would rule over the Jews (xv,
373-8). Herod showed his gratitude to him by dispensing the Essenes,
who were opposed to all oaths except their own oath of the Covenant,
from taking the vow of loyalty imposed on all his Jewish subjects. A
third Essene named Simon interpreted a dream of Archelaus,
ethnarch of Judaea (4 BCE-6 CE), in 4 BCE to mean that his rule
would last for ten years (XVII, 345-8). John the Essene, the last sectary
to be referred to by Josephus, was not a prophet, but the commander
or strategos of the district of Thamna in north-western Judaea, and of
the cities of Lydda (Lod), Joppa (Jaffa) and Emmaus at the beginning
of the first revolution (War 11, 567). A man of ‘first-rate prowess and
ability’, he fell in battle at Ascalon (III, II, I9).72
Finally, Josephus depicts in vivid language the bravery of the
Essenes subjected to torture by the Romans.
The war with the Romans tried their souls through and through by every
variety of test. Racked and twisted, burned and broken, and made to pass
through every instrument of torture in order to induce them to blaspheme
their lawgiver or to eat some forbidden thing, they refused to yield to either
demand, nor ever once did they cringe to their persecutors or shed a tear.
Smiling in their agonies and mildly deriding their tormentors, they
cheerfully resigned their souls, confident that they would receive them
back again.
(War 11, 152-3)

## Page 95

Since it would appear from this passage that the Romans were
persecuting not individuals, but a group, it is tempting, bearing in mind
the archaeologists’ claim that the Qumran settlement was destroyed by
the Romans, to associate it with the story of Essenes captured by the
Dead Sea. If such a surmise is correct, the sect’s disappearance from
history may well have been brought about in the lethal blow suffered by
its central establishment during the fateful summer of 68 CE. The fact
that no attempt was made to recover nearly 800 manuscripts from the
caves confirms, it would seem, such a reconstruction of the end of
Qumran and, with the annihilation of its central establishment, of the
whole Essene movement.

IV The Religious Ideas of the Community
The first essays in the 1950s on the religious outlook of the Qumran
sect all suffered from a serious defect in that scholars in those days
tended to envisage the Scrolls as self-contained and entitled to
independent treatment. Today, with the hindsight of five decades of
research and with the entire corpus to hand, it is easier to conceive of
the theology of the Community as part of the general doctrinal evolution
of ancient Judaism.
Nevertheless, it is no simple task to follow that development itself,
the reason being that the systematic exposition of beliefs and customs
is not a traditional Jewish discipline. In a sense, the Instruction on the
Two Spirits, incorporated in the Community Rule, alluded to earlier (p.
28), is an exception, forming the one and only doctrinal treatise among
ancient Hebrew writings. The theology of Judaism, biblical, inter-
Testamental, medieval or modern, when written by contemporary
Jewish authors, is often modelled consciously or unconsciously on
Christian dogmatic structures: God, creation, human destiny,
messianic redemption, judgement, resurrection, heaven and hell. Such
structures may and sometimes do distort the religious concepts of
Judaism. For example, the interest of the Church in the messianic role
of Jesus is apt to assign a greater importance to Messianism in
Jewish religion than the historical evidence justifies, and Paul’s
hostility to the ‘legalism’ of Israel obscures the Jewish recognition of
the humble realities of everyday life prescribed by the Law as no mere
‘works’ but as a path to holiness walked in obedience to God’s
commandments.
1 THE COVENANT
Since the key to any understanding of Judaism must be the notion of
the Covenant, it may safely be taken as an introduction to Essene


---

## Page 97

religious thought. The history of mankind and of the Jewish people has
seen a series of such covenants. God undertook never to destroy
mankind again by a flood; in exchange, Noah and his descendants
were required to abstain from shedding human blood and, on the ritual
level, from eating animal ‘flesh with the life, which is the blood, still in it’
(Gen. ix, 1-17). To Abraham, who was childless and landless, God
offered posterity and a country, provided he led a perfect life and
marked his body and that of all his male progeny with a visible
reminder of the Covenant between himself and heaven, circumcision
(Gen. xvii, 1-14). Again, in the days of Moses the Israelites were
declared ‘a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation’ (Exod. xix, 5), God’s
special possession, on condition that they obeyed the Torah, the
divine Teaching of the religious, moral, social and ritual precepts
recorded in the Pentateuch from Exodus xx and repeated in the
farewell discourse addressed by Moses to his people in the Book of
Deuteronomy. After the conquest of Canaan and the distribution of the
land to the tribes, the fulfilment of God’s promise to Abraham, the
Covenant was renewed by Joshua and the Israelites reasserted their
commitment to their heavenly Helper (Jos. xxiv). From then on, the
biblical story is one of continuous unfaithfulness to the Covenant. But
God was not to be thwarted by human unworthiness and ingratitude,
and for the sake of the handful of just men appearing in every
generation he allowed the validity of the Covenant to endure. Though
he punished the sinful and the rebellious, he spared the ‘remnant’
because of their fidelity to it. From time to time, saintly leaders of the
Jewish people, King David and King Josiah before the Babylonian
exile (2 Sam. vii; 2 Kings xxiii, 1-3) and Ezra the Priest after the return
from Mesopotamia (Neh. viii-x), persuaded them to remember their
Covenant with God with solemn vows of repentance and national
rededication; but the promises were usually short-lived. This would no
doubt account for the development of an idea in the sixth century BCE
of a ‘new Covenant’ founded not so much on undertakings entered into
by the community as on the inner transformation of every individual
Jew for whom the will of God was to become, as it were, second
nature.


---

## Page 98

The time is coming ... when I will make a new Covenant with Israel... This
is the new Covenant which I will make with Israel in those days ... I will set
my law within them and write it on their hearts...
(Jer. xxxi, 31-3; Isa. liv, 13)
It was this same Covenant ideology that served as the foundation of
the Qumran Community’s basic beliefs. The Essenes not only
considered themselves to be the ‘remnant’ of their time, but the
‘remnant’ of all time, the final ‘remnant’. In the ‘age of wrath’, while God
was making ready to annihilate the wicked, their founders had
repented. They had become the ‘Converts of Israel’ (cf. CD IV, 2;
4Q266 fr. 5 i). As a reward for their conversion, the Teacher of
Righteousness had been sent to establish for them a ‘new Covenant’,
which was to be the sole valid form of the eternal alliance between
God and Israel. Consequently, their paramount aim was to pledge
themselves to observe its precepts with absolute faithfulness.
Convinced that they belonged to a Community which alone interpreted
the Holy Scriptures correctly, theirs was ‘the last interpretation of the
Law’ (4Q266 fr. 11; 270 fr. 7 ii), and they devoted their exile in the
wilderness to the study of the Bible. Their intention was to do
according to all that had been ‘revealed from age to age, and as the
Prophets had revealed by His Holy Spirit’ (1QS VIII, 14-16; cf. 4Q265
fr. 7 ii).
Without an authentic interpretation it was not possible properly to
understand the Torah. All the Jews of the inter-Testamental era, the
Essenes as well as their rivals, agreed that true piety entails
obedience to the Law, but although its guidance reaches into so many
corners of life - into business and prayer, law court and kitchen,
marriage-bed and Temple - the 613 positive and negative
commandments of which it consists still do not provide for all the
problems encountered, especially those which arose in the centuries
following the formulation of biblical legislation. To give but one
example, the diaspora situation was not envisaged by the jurists of an
autonomous Jewish society.
Torah interpretation was entrusted to the priests and Levites during
the first two or three centuries following the Babylonian exile. Ezra and


---

## Page 99

his colleagues, the ancient scribes of Israel, ‘read from the book of the
Law... made its sense plain and gave instruction in what was read’. In
this passage from the Book of Nehemiah viii, 8, Jewish tradition
acknowledges the institution of a regular paraphrase of Scripture
known as Targum, or translation into the vernacular of the members of
the congregation. When the parties of the Pharisees, Sadducees,
Essenes, etc., came into being with their different convictions, they
justified them by interpretations suited to their needs.
A classic example of idiosyncratic Bible interpretation in the Scrolls
concerns a law on marriage. Since no directly relevant ruling is given in
the Pentateuch on whether a niece may marry her uncle, Pharisaic and
rabbinic Judaism understands this scriptural silence to mean that such
a union is licit. When the Bible wishes to declare a degree of kinship
unlawful, it does so: thus we read apropos of marriage between
nephew and aunt, ‘You shall not approach your mother’s sister’ (Lev.
xviii, 13). Thus a tradition surviving in the Babylonian Talmud is able to
go so far as even to praise marriage with a ‘sister’s daughter’ and to
proclaim it as a particularly saintly and generous act comparable to the
loving-kindness shown to the poor and needy (Yebamoth 62b). The
Qumran Essenes did not adopt this attitude at all. On the contrary, they
regarded an uncle-niece union as straightforward ‘fornication’.
Interpreted correctly, they maintained, the Leviticus precept signifies
the very opposite of the meaning accepted by their opponents; the
truth is that whatever applies to men in this respect applies also to
women.
Moses said, You shall not approach your mother’s sister (i.e. your aunt);
she is your mother’s near kin (Lev. xviii, 13). But although the laws against
incest are written for men, they also apply to women. When, therefore, a
brother’s daughter uncovers the nakedness of her father’s brother, she is
(also his) near kin.
(CD v, 8-11)
The Temple Scroll proclaims clearly this prohibition in proper legal
terms:


---

## Page 100

A man shall not take the daughter of his brother or the daughter of his
sister for this is abominable.
(11QT LXVI, 16-17)
Again, according to the strict views of the sectaries, fidelity to the
Covenant demanded not only obedience to the Law, to all that God
has ‘commanded by the hand of Moses’, but also adherence to the
teaching of ‘all His servants, the Prophets’ (1QS 1, 2-3). Although not
expressly stated, this special attention to the Prophets implies, firstly,
that the Essenes subscribed to the principle incorporated into the
opening paragraph of the Sayings of the Fathers in the Mishnah that
the Prophets served as an essential link in the transmission of the Law
from Moses to the rabbis.
Moses received the Torah from (God on) Sinai and passed it on to
Joshua; Joshua to the Elders (= Judges); the Elders to the Prophets; and
the Prophets passed it on to the members of the Great Assembly (= the
leaders of Israel in the post-exilic age).
(Aboth 1, 1)
The second inference to be drawn is that the sect believed the
Prophets to be not only teachers of morality, but also guides in the
domain of the final eschatological realities. But as in the case of the
Law, their writings were considered to contain pitfalls for the ignorant
and the misinformed, and only the Community’s sages knew how to
expound them correctly. Properly understood, the Books of Isaiah,
Hosea and the rest indicate the right path to be followed in the terrible
cataclysms of the last days. A simple reading can convey only their
superficial meaning, but not their profounder significance. The Book of
Daniel sets the biblical example here when it announces that
Jeremiah’s prediction that the Babylonian domination would last for
seventy years is not to be taken literally; the real and final message is
that seventy times seven years would separate Nebuchadnezzar from
the coming of the Messiah (Dan. ix, 21-4). But the Qumran sectaries
went even further than Daniel. They argued that it is quite impossible to
discover the meaning without an inspired interpreter because the


---

## Page 101

Prophets themselves were ignorant of the full import of what they
wrote. Habakkuk, for instance, was commanded to recount the history
of the ‘final generation’, but he did so without having any clear idea of
how far ahead the eschatological age lay. God ‘did not make known to
him when time would come to an end’. Knowledge of the authentic
teaching of the Prophets was the supreme talent of the Teacher of
Righteousness. The surviving Bible commentaries are almost all
concerned with predictions concerning the ultimate destiny of the
righteous and the wicked, the tribulations and final triumph of the
‘House of Judah’ and the concomitant annihilation of those who had
rebelled against God. But in addition to this general evidence of the
subject-matter, the Scrolls directly impute to the Teacher a particular
God-given insight into the hidden significance of prophecy. He was
‘the Teacher of Righteousness to whom God made known all the
mysteries... of His servants the Prophets’ (1QpHab VII, 1-5). He was
‘the Priest [in whose heart] God set [understanding] that he might
interpret all the words of His servants the Prophets, through whom He
foretold all that would happen to His people’ (1QpHab 11, 8-10). He
was the Teacher who ‘made known to the latter generations that which
God had done to the latter generation, the congregation of traitors, to
those who departed from the way’ (CD 1, 12-13). The Teacher’s
interpretation alone, propagated by his disciples, offered true
enlightenment and guidance.
Supported in this way by the infallible teaching of the Community, the
sectary believed himself to be living in the true city of God, the city of
the Covenant built on the Law and the Prophets (cf. CD VII, 13-18).
Again and again, the architectural metaphors used in the Scrolls
suggest security and protection. The sect is a ‘House of Holiness’, a
‘House of Perfection and Truth’ (IQS VIII, 5, 9), a ‘House of the Law’
(CD XIX (B2), 10, 13); it is a ‘sure House’ (CD III, 19) constructed on
solid foundations. Indeed the language used is reminiscent of Isaiah
xxviii, 16, and of Jesus’ simile about the Church built not on sand but
on rock (Matth. vii, 24-7; xvi, 18):
But I shall be as one who enters a fortified city,
as one who seeks refuge behind a high wall ...


---

## Page 102

I will [lean on] Thy truth, O my God.
For Thou wilt set the foundation on rock
and the framework by the measuring-cord of justice;
and the tried stones [Thou wilt lay]
by the plumb-line [of truth],
to [build] a mighty [wall] which shall not sway;
and no man entering there shall stagger.
(1QH XIV [formerly VI], 24-7)
Fortified by his membership of the brotherhood, the sectary could even
carry his notions of solidity and firmness over into his own self so that
he too became a ‘strong tower’:
Thou hast strengthened me
before the battles of wickedness...
Thou hast made me like a strong tower, a high wall,
and hast established my edifice upon rock;
eternal foundations
serve for my ground,
and all my ramparts are a tried wall
which shall not sway.
(1QH xv [formerly VII], 7-9)
2 ELECTION AND HOLY LIFE IN THE
COMMUNITY OF THE COVENANT
In the ideology of the Old Testament, to be a member of the chosen
people is synonymous with being party to the Covenant. Israel willingly
accepts the yoke of the Law given on Sinai, and God in his turn
acknowledges her as His ‘special possession’ (Exod. xix, 5):
For you are a people holy to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has
chosen you to be a people for His own possession, out of all the peoples
that are on the face of the earth ... You shall therefore be careful to do the
commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances which I command
you this day.
(Deut. vii, 6, 11)


---

## Page 103

Theoretically, there is no distinction between election de jure and
election de facto: every Jew is chosen. But already in biblical times a
deep gulf is in fact seen to divide righteous observers of the Covenant
from the wicked of Israel. Though not deprived of their birthright, the
unfaithful are viewed as burdened with guilt and as such excluded,
provisionally at least, from the congregation of the children of God. The
fully developed concept of election is summarized in the Palestinian
Talmud by the third-century CE Galilean Rabbi Lazar. Expounding the
words of Deuteronomy quoted above, he comments:
When the Israelites do the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, they are
called sons; but when they do not do His will, they are not called sons.
(Kiddushin 61c)
Inevitably, for the Qumran Essenes such a notion of Covenant
membership was far too elastic. Consistent with their approach to
legal matters, their attitude in regard to the Covenant was that only the
initiates of their own ‘new Covenant’ were to be reckoned among
God’s elect and, as such, united already on earth with the angels of
heaven.
God has given them to His chosen ones
and has caused them to inherit
the lot of the Holy Ones.
He has joined their assembly
to the Sons of Heaven,
to be a Council of the Community,
a foundation of the Building of Holiness,
an eternal Plantation throughout all ages to come.
(1QS XI, 7-9)
They insisted, moreover, on the individual election of each sectary. The
ordinary Jew envisaged entry into the congregation of the chosen
primarily through birth, and secondly through the symbolical initiation of
an eight-day-old male infant submitted to circumcision. An Essene
became a member of either branch of his sect by virtue of the


---

## Page 104

deliberate and personal adult commitment of himself. For this reason,
as will be remembered, even children born to married members and
brought up in their schools had to wait until their twentieth birthday
before they were allowed to make their solemn vows of entry into the
Covenant. Also, believing in divine foreknowledge, they considered
their adherence to the ‘lot of God’ as the effect of grace, as having
been planned for each of them in heaven from all eternity. They, the
elect, were guided by the spirit of truth in the ways of light, while the
unprivileged, Jew and Gentile alike, were doomed to wander along
paths of darkness. The section of the Community Rule known as the
Instruction on the Two Spirits gives a fascinating description of these
two human groups, the chosen and the unchosen.
The Master shall instruct all the sons of light and shall teach them the
nature of all the children of men according to the kind of spirit which
they possess ...
From the God of Knowledge comes all that is and shall be. Before
ever they existed He established their whole design, and when, as
ordained for them, they come into being, it is in accord with His
glorious design that they accomplish their task without change ...
He has created man to govern the world, and has appointed for him
two spirits in which to walk until the time of His visitation: the spirits of
truth and injustice. Those born of truth spring from a fountain of light,
but those born of injustice spring from a source of darkness. All the
children of righteousness are ruled by the Prince of Light and walk in
the ways of light, but all the children of injustice are ruled by the Angel
of Darkness and walk in the ways of darkness. The Angel of Darkness
leads all the children of righteousness astray, and until his end, all their
sins, iniquities, wickedness, and all their unlawful deeds are caused by
his dominion in accordance with the mysteries of God...
But the God of Israel and His Angel of Truth will succour all the sons
of light. For it is He who created the spirits of Light and Darkness and
founded every action upon them and established every deed [upon]
their [ways]. And He loves the one everlastingly and delights in its
works for ever; but the counsel of the other He loathes and for ever
hates its ways.

## Page 105

(IQS III, 13-IV I)
Convictions of this kind, with their theories of individual election and
predestination, coupled with a precise knowledge of the boundary
dividing right from wrong, can lead to self-righteousness and arrogant
intolerance of the masses thought to be rejected by God. The
Essenes, however, appear to have concentrated more on the
blessedness of the chosen than on the damnation of the
unpredestined. Besides, they could always argue that Jews who
refused to repent and remained outside the new Covenant were
responsible for their own doom.
But the spiritual masters of the Community were doubtless aware of
the danger of the sin of pride to which their less enlightened brothers
were exposed and attacked it on three fronts. The Qumran Hymns,
unlike certain biblical Psalms (e.g. Psalm xxvi) which testify to an acute
form of sanctimoniousness, never cease to emphasize the sectary’s
frailty, unworthiness and total dependence on God.
Clay and dust that I am,
what can I devise unless Thou wish it,
and what contrive unless Thou desire it?
What strength shall I have
unless Thou keep me upright
and how shall I understand
unless by (the spirit) which Thou hast shaped for me?
(IQH XVIII [formerly x], 5-7)
Not only is election itself owed to God’s grace, but perseverance in the
way of holiness cannot be counted on unless he offers his continuous
help and support.
When the wicked rose against Thy Covenant
and the damned against Thy word,
I said in my sinfulness,
‘I am forsaken by Thy Covenant.’
But calling to mind the might of Thy hand
and the greatness of Thy compassion,
I rose and stood ...

I lean on Thy grace
and on the multitude of Thy mercies.
(IQH XII [formerly IV], 34-7)
Another theme constantly stressed in Essene teaching is that not only
is God’s assistance necessary in order to remain faithful to his Law;
the very knowledge of that Law is a gift from heaven. All their special
understanding and wisdom comes from God.
From the source of His righteousness
is my justification,
and from His marvellous mysteries
is the light in my heart.
My eyes have gazed
on that which is eternal,
on wisdom concealed from men,
on knowledge and wise design
(hidden) from the sons of men;
on a fountain of righteousness
and on a storehouse of power,
on a spring of glory
(hidden) from the assembly of flesh.
God has given them to His chosen ones
as an everlasting possession,
and has caused them to inherit
the lot of the Holy Ones.
(IQS XI, 5-8)
The sentiments expressed in the Hymns, of love and gratitude and
awareness of God’s presence, represent a true religiousness and
must have helped the sectary not to allow his life - governed as it was
by laws and precepts-to slide into one of mere religious formalism.
Thou hast upheld me with certain truth;
Thou hast delighted me with Thy Holy Spirit
and [hast opened my heart] till this day ...
The abundance of (Thy) forgiveness is with my steps
and infinite mercy accompanies Thy judgement of me.
Until I am old Thou wilt care for me;
for my father knew me not
and my mother abandoned me to Thee.

## Page 107

For Thou art a father
to all [the sons] of Thy truth,
and as a woman who tenderly loves her babe,
so dost Thou rejoice in them;
and as a foster-father bearing a child in his lap,
so carest Thou for all Thy creatures.
(IQH XVII [formerly IX], 32-6)
Whether the average Essene actually succeeded in fulfilling his high
ideals, we cannot of course know: experience past and present has
shown that paths to sanctity devised by organized religion are beset
with snares. As has been noted earlier (pp. 31-2 on 4Q477), in some
individual cases, moral shortcomings were actually recorded. But there
can be no doubt of the sectaries’ intention. The aim of a holy life lived
within the Covenant was to penetrate the secrets of heaven in this
world and to stand before God for ever in the next. Like Isaiah, who
beheld the seraphim proclaiming ‘Holy, holy, holy’, and like Ezekiel,
who in a trance watched the winged cherubim drawing the divine
throne-chariot, and like the ancient Jewish mystics who consecrated
themselves, despite official disapproval by the rabbis, to the
contemplation of the same throne-chariot and the heavenly Palaces,
the Essenes, too, strove for a similar mystical knowledge, as one of
their number testifies in a description of his own vision of the ministers
of the ‘Glorious Face’.
The [cheru]bim prostrate themselves before Him and bless. As they rise, a
whispered divine voice [is heard], and there is a roar of praise. When they
drop their wings, there is a [whispere]d divine voice. The cherubim bless
the image of the throne-chariot above the firmament, [and] they praise [the
majes]ty of the luminous firmament beneath His seat of glory. When the
wheels advance, angels of holiness come and go. From between His
glorious wheels there is as it were a fiery vision of most holy spirits. About
them, the appearance of rivulets of fire in the likeness of gleaming brass,
and a work of ... radiance in many-coloured glory, marvellous pigments,
clearly mingled. The spirits of the living ‘gods’ move perpetually with the
glory of the marvellous chariot(s). The whispered voice of blessing
accompanies the roar of their advance, and they praise the Holy One on
their way of return. When they ascend, they ascend marvellously, and
when they settle, they stand still. The sound of joyful praise is silenced
and there is a whispered blessing of the ‘gods’ in all the camps of God.

(4Q405 20, ii-22)
3 WORSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY OF THE
COVENANT
In addition to the worship of God offered through a life of holiness, the
Qumran sectary had more particularly to perform the ritual acts
prescribed by Moses in the correct manner and at the right times. The
earthly liturgy was intended to be a replica of that sung by the choirs of
angels in the celestial Temple.
To judge from the many references to it, the time element both
calendric and horary was crucial. The Community Rule lays down that
the Community was not to ‘depart from any command of God
concerning their times; they shall be neither early nor late for any of
their appointed times, they shall stray neither to the right nor to the left
of any of His true precepts’ (IQS 1, 13-15). This injunction asks for
exact punctuality in regard to the two daily moments of prayer meant to
coincide with and replace the perpetual burnt-offering sacrificed in the
Temple at sunrise and sunset (Exod. xxix, 30; Num. xxviii, 4), but it
demands in addition a strict observance of the sect’s own liturgical
calendar.
He shall bless Him [with the offering] of the lips at the times ordained by
Him: at the beginning of the dominion of light, and at its end when it retires
to its appointed place; at the beginning of the watches of darkness when
He unlocks their storehouse and spreads them out, and also at their end
when they retire before the light; when the heavenly lights shine out from
the dwelling-place of Holiness, and also when they retire to the place of
Glory; at the entry of the (monthly) seasons on the days of the new moon,
and also at their end when they succeed to one another ...
(IQS IX, 26-x, 4)
To understand the peculiarity of Essenism in this respect, a few
words need to be said about the calendar followed by non-sectarian
Judaism. Essentially, this was regulated by the movements of the


---

## Page 109

moon; months varied in duration from twenty-nine to thirty days and the
year consisted of twelve months of 354 days. Needless to say, such a
lunar year does not correspond to the four seasons determined by the
movements of the sun in terms of solstices and equinoxes. The
shortfall of about ten days between the lunar and the solar years was
therefore compensated for by means of ‘intercalation’, i.e. by inserting
after Adar (February/March), the twelfth month of the year, a
supplementary ‘Second Adar’ at the end of every thirty-six lunar
months.
The Qumran sect rejected this seemingly artificial system and
adopted instead a chronological reckoning, probably of priestly origin,
based on the sun, a practice attested also in the Book of Jubilees and
1 Enoch, and fully laid out in the remains of a series of calendrical
documents (4Q320-30). The outstanding feature of this solar calendar
was its absolute regularity in that, instead of 354 days, not divisible by
seven, it consisted of 364 days, i.e. fifty-two weeks precisely. Each of
its four seasons was thirteen weeks long divided into three months of
thirty days each, plus an additional ‘remembrance’ day (IQS x, 5)
linking one season to another (13 x 7 = 91 = 3 x 30 + I). In tune in this
way with the ‘laws of the Great Light of heaven’ (IQH XII, 5) and not with
the ‘festivals of the nations’ (4QpHos=4Q171 11, 16), Qumran saw its
calendar as corresponding to ‘the certain law from the mouth of God’
(IQH xx [formerly XII], 9). Its unbroken rhythm meant furthermore that the
first day of the year and of each subsequent season always fell on the
same day of the week. For the Essenes this was Wednesday, since
according to Genesis i, 14-19, it was on the fourth day that the sun and
the moon were created. Needless to add, the same monotonous
sequence also implied that all the feasts of the year always fell on the
same day of the week: Passover, the fifteenth day of the first month,
was always celebrated on a Wednesday; the Feast of Weeks, the
fifteenth day of the third month, always on a Sunday; the Day of
Atonement, the tenth day of the seventh month, on a Friday; the Feast
of Tabernacles, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, on a
Wednesday, etc. This solar calendar with its eternal regularity cannot
of course stand up to the astronomical calculation of 365 days 5 hours
48 minutes and 48 seconds to the year, but the Scrolls so far


---

## Page 110

published give no indication of how the Essenes proposed to cope
with this inconvenience, or whether indeed they were even aware of it.
One practical consequence of the sect’s adherence to a calendar at
variance with that of the rest of Judaism was that its feast-days were
working days for other Jews and vice versa. The Wicked Priest was
thus able to travel (journeys of any distance being forbidden on holy
days of rest) to the ‘place of exile’ of the Teacher of Righteousness
while he and his followers were celebrating the Day of Atonement (cf.
above, p. 55). In fact, it is likely that the persecutors of the sect
deliberately chose that date to oblige the sectaries to attend to them
on what they considered to be their ‘Day of Fasting’ and ‘Sabbath of
repose’, and thus ‘confuse them and cause them to stumble’. The
same sort of story is told in the Mishnah of the Patriarch Gamaliel II,
who endeavoured to humiliate Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah by sending
him the following instruction: ‘I charge you that you come to me with
your staff and your money on the Day of Atonement according to your
reckoning’ (Rosh ha-Shanah II, 9).
Another peculiarity of the liturgical calendar of the Community,
attested in the Temple Scroll, was the division of the year into seven
fifty-day periods - hence the name pentecontad calendar - each
marked by an agricultural festival, e.g. the Feast of New Wine, the
Feast of Oil, etc. A similar system is mentioned by Philo in connection
with the Therapeutae in his book, On the Contemplative Life. One of
these festivals, the Feast of the New Wheat, coincided with the Feast
of Weeks and was for the Essenes/Therapeutae also the principal holy
day of the year, that of the Renewal of the Covenant, the importance of
which is discussed above (p. 44). From the Book of Jubilees, where,
as has been said, the same calendar is followed, it is clear that
Pentecost (the Feast of Weeks), together with the Feast of the
Renewal of the Covenant, were celebrated on the fifteenth day of the
third month (Jub. VI, 17-19; cf. also 4Q266 fr. II ii; 270 fr. 7 ii). An
outline of the ceremony performed on this holy day, with its confession
of sin and its blessings and curses, is preserved in the Community
Rule (IQS I, 16-11, 25; cf. also 4Q280, 286-7). The sectaries assemble
for the service in strict hierarchical order: the priests first, ranked in
order of status, after them the Levites, and lastly ‘all the people one


---

## Page 111

after another in their Thousands, Hundreds, Fifties and Tens, that every
Israelite may know his place in the Community of God according to the
everlasting design’ (IQS 11, 22-3). Blessing God, the priests then
recite his acts of loving-kindness to Israel and the Levites recall Israel’s
rebellions against him. This recognition of guilt is followed by an act of
public repentance appropriate to a community of converts.
We have strayed! We have [disobeyed!] We and our fathers before us have
sinned and acted wickedly in walking [counter to the precepts] of truth and
righteousness. [And God has] judged us and our fathers also; but He has
bestowed His bountiful mercy on us from everlasting to everlasting.
(IQS I, 24-11, 1)
After the confession, the priests solemnly bless the converts of Israel,
calling down on them in particular the gifts of wisdom and knowledge :
May He bless you with all good and preserve you from all evil! May He
lighten your heart with life-giving wisdom and grant you eternal knowledge!
May He raise His merciful face towards you for everlasting bliss!
(IQS II, 2-4)
This paraphrase of the blessing of Israel which God commanded
Moses to transmit to Aaron and his sons in Numbers vi, 24-6, and
which recalls the fourth of the daily Eighteen Benedictions of traditional
Judaism, is accompanied by a Levitical curse of the party of Belial and
a special malediction directed by both priests and Levites at any
sectary whose conversion may be insincere:
Cursed be the man who enters this Covenant while walking among the
idols of his heart, who sets up before himself his stumbling-block of sin
so that he may backslide! Hearing the words of this Covenant, he blesses
himself in his heart and says, ‘Peace be with me, even though I walk in the
stubbornness of my heart’...
(IQS II, 11-12)
The Cave 4 sources of the Damascus Document depict also the ritual


---

## Page 112

of dismissal from the Community. The Priest overseeing the
Congregation, addressing God, declares:
Thou hast cursed those who transgress (the boundary) but we
maintain it.
Thereupon ‘the dismissed man shall leave and whoever eats from
what is his or greets the man who has been dismissed, and agrees
with him, ... his judgement shall be complete’ (4Q266 fr. 11 I ii; 270 fr. 7
ii).
Each benediction and curse is approved by the whole congregation
with a twice repeated ‘Amen’.
The ceremony of the Renewal of the Covenant seems to be the only
rite described in any detail in the Community Rule and the Damascus
Document, but as the Essenes laid so much emphasis on the full and
punctilious observance of the Law of Moses it may be taken for
granted that they did not omit the many other basic acts of Jewish
religion and worship. The fact that the Community Rule is satisfied
simply to state without any specification that a single deliberate
transgression of the Mosaic Law would entail irrevocable expulsion
from the sect implies that the elite sectaries subject to this rule did not
need detailed guidance: they were supposed to be fully versed in the
Torah. Legislation addressed to less well-trained members, contained
in the Damascus Document and in the Temple Scroll, is more
discursive. Circumcision, for example, which was certainly practised,
is mentioned in connection with female uncleanness after childbirth
when Leviticus xii, 3 is cited in passing (4Q266 fr. 6 ii). It is also
referred to figuratively in the context of severing the ‘foreskin of the evil
inclination’ (IQS v, 5), or possibly and by implication as the ‘Covenant
of Abraham’ mentioned in connection with (Gentile) man-servants (CD
XII, II; XVI, 6). The laws of purity were also assuredly essential to the
sect, and some practical guidance is given in IIQTS XLVI-LI, 4Q274-
84, and MMT. The dietary laws are dealt with in the Damascus
Document, MMT and the Temple Scroll. For instance, the eating of
‘live creatures’ (e.g. larvae of bees, fish and locusts) is declared to be
prohibited in CD XII, 11-15. MMT states that a live animal foetus must
be slaughtered before becoming fit for consumption (4Q396 frs. 1-21).


---

## Page 113

Further laws appear in the Temple Scroll XLVII-XLVIII. Josephus also
remarks that an Essene was forbidden to eat food prepared by people
not belonging to the brotherhood (War 11, 143).
On three other topics, the Qumran sources are less taciturn: ritual
ablutions, Temple worship and the sacred meal. Discussed already as
part of the life of the sect, it remains now to consider the doctrinal
significance of these rites.
Josephus, as will be recalled, observes that the Essenes took a
ritual bath twice daily before meals (cf. War 11, 129, 132). 4Q414-
entitled ‘Baptismal liturgy’ - deals definitely with such a bathing ritual
but the text is so mutilated that no readable translation is possible. As
regards the bath itself, the Damascus Document adds that the
minimum quantity of clean water required for a valid act of purification
was to be the amount necessary to cover a man (CD x, 12-13). This is
not of course an Essene invention, but typically, where the Mishnah
prescribes a minimum of forty seahs (about 120 gallons), the sect’s
teaching concentrates on the practical purpose of the Mishnaic rule,
namely that ‘in them men may immerse themselves’ (Mikwaot VII, I),
and eliminates the obligation of having carefully to measure out what
that quantity should be. Of greater interest, however, is the theological
aspect, with its insistence on a correlation between the inner condition
of a man and the outer rite. The wicked, according to the Community
Rule, ‘shall not enter the water ... for they shall not be cleansed unless
they turn from their wickedness’ (IQS v, 13-14). True purification
comes from the ‘spirit of holiness’ and true cleansing from the ‘humble
submission’ of the soul to all God’s precepts.
For it is through the spirit of true counsel concerning the ways of man that
all his sins shall be expiated ... He shall be cleansed from all his sins by
the spirit of holiness ... and his iniquity shall be expiated by the spirit of
uprightness and humility. And when his flesh is sprinkled with purifying
water and sanctified by cleansing water, it shall be made clean by the
humble submission of his soul to all the precepts of God.
(IQS III, 6-9)
The second issue has to do with the sect’s attitude towards the
Temple and Temple sacrifice. While some Essenes, notwithstanding


---

## Page 114

their vow of total fidelity to the Law of Moses, rejected the validity of the
Sanctuary and refused to participate (temporarily) in its rites (cf. Philo,
Omnis probus 75; Josephus, Antiquities XVIII, 19), they evaded the
theological dilemma in which this stand might have placed them by
contending that until the rededication of the Temple, the only true
worship of God was to be offered in their establishment. The Council
of the Community was to be the ‘Most Holy Dwelling for Aaron’ where,
‘without the flesh of holocausts and the fat of sacrifice‘, a ‘sweet
fragrance’ was to be sent up to God, and where prayer was to serve
‘as an acceptable fragrance of righteousness’ (IQS VIII, 8-9; IX, 4-5).
The Community itself was to be the sacrifice offered to God in
atonement for Israel’s sins (IQS VIII, 4-5; 4Q265 fr. 7 ii).
Besides this evidence in the Community Rule, the equation of the
Council of the Community with the Temple also appears in the
Habakkuk Commentary (XII, 3-4) in a most interesting interpretation of
the word ‘Lebanon’. Traditionally, ‘Lebanon’ is understood by ancient
Jewish interpreters to symbolize ‘the Temple’. For example,
Deuteronomy iii, 25, ‘Let me go over ... and see ... that goodly
mountain and Lebanon‘, is rendered in Targum Onkelos as, ‘Let me
go over ... and see ... that goodly mountain and the Temple’. The
Qumran commentator, explaining the Habakkuk text, ‘For the violence
done to Lebanon shall overwhelm you’ (Hab. 11, 17), proceeds from
the belief that the Council of the Community is the one valid Temple.
He then sets out to prove it by directly associating Lebanon with the
Council in the conviction that the traditional exegesis will be familiar to
all his readers: Lebanon = Temple. Temple = Council of the
Community, ergo Lebanon = Council of the Community.73
The symbolical approach of the sect to sacrificial worship may
account for Essene celibacy (where it was practised). Sexual
abstinence was imposed on those participating in the Temple
services, both priests and laymen; no person who had sexual
intercourse (or an involuntary emission, or even any physical contact
with a menstruating woman) could lawfully take part. More importantly
still, bearing in mind the central place occupied by prophecy in Essene
doctrine, clear indications exist in inter-Testamental and rabbinic
literature that a similar renunciation was associated with the prophetic


---

## Page 115

state. Thus Moses, in order always to be ready to hear the voice of
God, is said by Philo to have cleansed himself of ‘all calls of mortal
nature, food, drink, and intercourse with women’ (Life of Moses 11, 68-
9). Consequently, despite the attempt made by Philo and by Josephus
to attribute the sect’s celibacy to misogyny, a more reasonable
explanation would be that it was thought that lives intended to be wholly
consecrated to worship and wholly preoccupied with meditation on
prophecy should be kept wholly, and not just intermittently, pure.
The common table of the Essenes, the third special cultic subject to
be examined, has already been discussed in Chapter II (p. 32), but
one remaining point needs to be mentioned, namely that since the
rules relating to the daily meal and the messianic meal are the same, it
is not unreasonable to infer from the New Testament parallel that the
former was thought to prefigure the latter. As is well known, the
evangelist Matthew portrays the Last Supper as the prototype of the
great eschatological feast, quoting Jesus as saying:
I tell you, I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when
I drink it new with you in my Father’s Kingdom.
(Matth. xxvi, 29)
4 FUTURE EXPECTATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY
OF THE COVENANT
The Essene sect was born into a world of eschatological ferment, of
intense expectation of the end foretold by the Prophets. Using biblical
models as vehicles for their own convictions, the Teacher of
Righteousness and the Community’s sages projected an image of the
future which is elaborate and colourful, but which cannot always be fully
comprehended by us, partly because some of the associations
escape us, and partly because of gaps in the extant texts. They
foresaw in their Community’s story the fulfilment of the prophetic
expectations concerning the salvation of the righteous. It was from their
ranks, swollen by the re-conversion of some of the ‘Simple of Ephraim’

## Page 116

(4QpNah=4Q169 III, 4-5) who had caused such distress by their
previous apostasy, and by other Jewish recruits (IQSa I, 1-5; cf. also
4Q471a), that the sons of Light would go to battle against the sons of
Darkness. The Community or the ‘exiles of the desert’ would move to
Jerusalem after a preliminary attack on the ‘army of Belial’, symbolized
by the ‘ungodly of the Covenant’ and their foreign allies from the
environs of Judaea, and an assault on the Kittim occupying the Holy
Land. These events were expected to cover a period of six years. The
seventh, the first sabbatical year of the War, would see the restoration
of Temple worship.
Of the remaining thirty-three years of its duration, four would be
sabbatical years, so the War would be waged during twenty-nine:
against the ‘sons of Shem’ for nine years, against the ‘sons of Ham’ for
ten years, and against the ‘sons of Japheth’ for another ten years (IQM
I-II). The final conflict would end with the total defeat of the ‘King of the
Kittim’ and of Satan’s hosts, and with the joyful celebrations of the
Hero, i.e. God, by the victorious sons of Light.
[Rise up, O Hero!
Lead off Thy captives, O Glorious One!
Gather up] Thy spoils, O Author of mighty deeds!
Lay Thy hand on the neck of Thine enemies
and Thy feet [on the pile of the slain!
Smite the nations, Thine adversaries],
and devour the flesh of the sinner with Thy sword!
Fill Thy land with glory
and Thine inheritance with blessing!
[Let there be a multitude of cattle in Thy fields,
and in] Thy palaces
[silver and gold and precious stones]!
O Zion, rejoice greatly!
Rejoice all you cities of Judah!
[Keep your gates ever open
that the] hosts of the nations
[may be brought in]!
Their kings shall serve you
and all your oppressors shall bow down before you;
[they shall lick the dust of your feet.
Shout for joy, O daughters of] my people!


---

## Page 117

Deck yourselves with glorious jewels
[and rule over the kingdom of the nations!
Sovereignty shall be to the Lord]
and everlasting dominion to Israel.
(IQM XIX, 2-8)
Such was to be the course of the War in its earthly dimensions. But it
would possess in addition a cosmic quality. The hosts of the sons of
Light, commanded by the ‘Prince of the Congregation’, were to be
supported by the angelic armies led by the ‘Prince of Light’, also
known in the Scrolls as the archangel Michael or Melchizedek.
Similarly, the ‘ungodly of the Covenant’ and their Gentile associates
were to be aided by the demonic forces of Satan, or Belial, or
Melkiresha’. These two opposing camps were to be evenly matched,
and God’s intervention alone would bring about the destruction of evil
(IQM XVIII, 1-3). Elsewhere the grand finale is represented as a
judgement scene in which the heavenly prince Melchizedek
recompenses ‘the Holy Ones of God’ and executes ‘the vengeance of
the judgements of God’ over Belial and his lot (IIQMelch II, 9, 13). Yet, if
my interpretation of another non-messianic composition (4Q246) is
correct, the symbolical opponent, usurping in this writing the title ‘son
of God’ and ‘son of the Most High‘, is said to be overcome by ‘the
people of God’ ready to establish with the help of the Great God an
eternal kingdom.
The role of the priests and Levites in this imaginary ultimate
grappling of good with evil, as described in the War Scroll, emerges
as that of non-combatants, performing various battle rituals and
directing the various war activities (advance, retreat, ambush, etc.).
However, it is more difficult to determine the function of the
commander-in-chief, the so-called ‘Prince of the Congregation’. We
learn that on his shield will be inscribed his name, the names of Israel,
Levi and Aaron, and those of the twelve tribes and their chiefs (IQM v,
1-2); but little room appears to be left in the War Rule for him to act as
the Royal Messiah. God himself is the supreme agent of salvation and
after him in importance is Michael.
In some other Scrolls, by contrast, the theme of Messianism is more


---

## Page 118

prominent. Complex and sui generis, it envisages sometimes one
messianic figure, royal, Davidic, triumphant (4Q285, 4Q161, and the
Damascus Document speaking of the Messiah - in the singular, cf.
4Q266 fr. 11 i, 12 - of Aaron and Israel), again and again two, and
once possibly even three Messiahs. The lay King-Messiah, otherwise
known as the ‘Branch of David’, the ‘Messiah of Israel’, the ‘Prince of
[all] the Congregation’ and the ‘Sceptre’, was to usher in, according to
the sect’s book of Blessings, ‘the Kingdom of his people’ and ‘bring
death to the ungodly’ and defeat ‘[the kings of the] nations’ (IQSb v, 21,
25, 28). The recently and groundlessly advanced theory that ‘the Prince
of the Congregation, Branch of David’ of 4Q285 is a suffering and
executed Messiah is contradicted both by the immediate context and
the broader exegetical framework of Isaiah x, 34-xi, I on which 4Q285
depends (cf. 4Q161, frs. 8-10; IQSb v, 20-29). As befits a priestly sect,
however, the Priest-Messiah comes first in the order of precedence;
he is also called the ‘Messiah of Aaron’, the ‘Priest’, the ‘Interpreter of
the Law’ (cf. IQSa II, 20). The King-Messiah was to defer to him and to
the priestly authority in general in all legal matters: ‘As they teach him,
so shall he judge’ (4QpIsa=4Q161 frs. 8-11, 1.23). The ‘Messiah of
Aaron’ was to be the final Teacher, ‘he who shall teach righteousness
at the end of days’ (CD VI, II). But he was also to preside over the
battle liturgy (IQM xv, 4; XVI, 13; XVIII, 5) and the eschatological
banquet (IQSa II, 12-21). It seems that there are some allusions
suggesting that the eschatological High Priest was expected to
undergo suffering and humiliation before being glorified (see 4Q4Ib,
49I fr. II, 54I, fr. 9).
The third figure, ‘the Prophet’, is mentioned directly though briefly
only once: we are told that his arrival was expected together with that
of the Messiahs of Aaron and Israel (IQS ix, II). The whole messianic
phrase is absent, however, from all the extant 4Q manuscripts of the
Community Rule. Viewed in the context of inter-Testamental Jewish
ideas, the Prophet was to be either an Elijah returned as a precursor
of the Messiah (Mal. iv, 5; 1 Enoch xc, 31, 37; Matth. xi, 13; xvii, 12), or
as a divine guide sent to Israel in the final days (I Mac. iv, 46; xiv, 41;
Jn. i, 21), no doubt identical with ‘the Prophet’ promised by God to
Moses (‘I will raise up for them a prophet like you ... He shall convey all


---

## Page 119

my commands to them‘, Deut. xviii, 15-18; cf. Acts iii, 22-3; vii, 37). An
identification of ‘the Prophet’ with a ‘new Moses’ is supported by the
inclusion of the Deuteronomy passage in the Messianic Anthology or
Testimonia from Cave 4 (4Q175) as the first of three messianic proof-
texts, the second being Balaam’s prophecy concerning the Star to rise
out of Jacob (Num. xxiv, 15-17), and the third, the blessing of Levi by
Moses (Deut. xxxiii, II), prefiguring respectively the royal Messiah and
the Priest-Messiah.
If it is proper to deduce from these not too explicit data that, if ever
expected by the Qumran sect, the messianic Prophet (or prophetic
Messiah) was to teach the truth revealed on the eve of the
establishment of the Kingdom, it would follow that his part was to all
intents and purposes the same as that attributed by the Qumran
Essenes to the Teacher of Righteousness. If this is correct, it would not
be unreasonable to suggest that at some point of the sect’s history the
coming of the Prophet was no longer expected; he was believed to
have already appeared in the person of the Teacher of Righteousness.
The evidence available does not permit categorical statements on
the sectaries’ views about what was to follow the days of the
Messiahs. Some kind of metamorphosis was awaited by them, as is
clear from the Community Rule - ‘until the determined end, and until the
Renewal’ (IQS IV, 25). But one cannot be sure that it was understood
as synonymous with the new creation of the Apocalypses of Ezra (vii,
75) and Baruch (xxxii, 6). Similarly, the ‘new Jerusalem’ described in
various manuscripts (cf. IQ32; 2Q24; 4Q554-555; 5Q15; 11Q18) does
not match by definition the Holy City descending from above of I Enoch
(xc, 28-9) or Revelation xxi, but could be an earthly city rebuilt
according to the plans of angelic architects.
As for the afterlife proper, and the place it occupied in Essene
thought, for many centuries in the biblical age Jews paid little attention
to this question. They believed with most peoples in antiquity that after
death the just and wicked alike would share a miserable, shadowy
existence in Sheol, the underworld, where even God is forgotten: ‘Turn,
O Lord, save my life,’ cries the psalmist, ‘for in death there is no
remembrance of thee; in Sheol who can give thee praise?’ (Ps. vi, 5;
cf. Isa. xxxviii, 18; Ps. lxxxviii, 10-12, etc.) The general hope was for a

long and prosperous life, many children, a peaceful death in the midst
of one’s family, and burial in the tomb of one’s fathers. Needless to
say, with this simple outlook went a most sensitive appreciation of the
present time as being the only moment in which man can be with God.
Eventually, the innate fear of death, and the dissatisfaction of later
biblical thinkers with a divine justice that allowed the wicked to flourish
on earth and the just to suffer, led to attempts in the post-exilic era to
solve this fundamental dilemma. The idea of resurrection, or rather of
the reunification of body and soul after death, first appears as a
metaphor in Ezekiel’s vision of the re-birth of the Jewish nation after
the Babylonian captivity as the re-animation of dry bones (Ezek. xxxvii;
cf. also 4Q385 frs. 2-3). Later, after the historical experience of
martyrdom under the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, resurrection
was expected to be the true reward of individuals who freely gave their
lives for God—i.e. for their religion (Dan. xii, 2; 2 Mac. vii, 9; xii, 44; xiv,
46, etc.). At the same time, the notion of immortality also emerged, the
idea that the righteous are to be vindicated and live for ever in God’s
presence. This view is developed fully in the Greek apocryphal Book of
Wisdom (iii, I-V, 16).
Josephus tells us that the Essenes subscribed to this second school
of thought. According to him, they adopted a distinctly Hellenistic
concept of immortality, holding the flesh to be a prison out of which the
indestructible soul of the just escapes into limitless bliss ‘in an abode
beyond the ocean’ after its final deliverance (War II, 154-8).
Resurrection, implying a return of the spirit to a material body, can thus
play no part in this scheme.
Until recently, the Scrolls themselves have not been particularly
helpful. The Hymns include equivocal statements such as, ‘Hoist a
banner, O you who lie in the dust! O bodies gnawed by worms, raise
up an ensign ...!’ (1QH XIV [formerly VI], 34-5; cf. XIX [formerly xi], 10-
14), which may connote bodily resurrection. On the other hand, the
poet’s language may just be allegorical. Immortality, as distinct from
resurrection, is better attested. The substance of Josephus’ account is
confirmed, though not surprisingly without any typically Hellenistic
colouring (no doubt introduced by him to please his Greek readers).
The Community Rule, discussing the reward of the righteous and the


---

## Page 121

wicked, assures the just of ‘eternal joy in life without end, a crown of
glory and a garment of majesty in unending light’ (IQS IV, 7-8), and
sinners of ‘eternal torment and endless disgrace together with
shameful extinction in the fire of the dark regions’ (IQS IV, 12-13). It is
interesting to observe that immortality was not conceived of as an
entirely new state, but rather as a direct continuation of the position
attained on entry into the Community. From that moment, the sectary
was raised to an ‘everlasting height’ and joined to the ‘everlasting
Council‘, the ‘congregation of the Sons of Heaven’ (1QH xi [formerly III],
20-22).
Shortly after the ‘liberation’ of the Scrolls in 1991 a previously
unknown poetic text, usually designated as the ‘Resurrection fragment’
(4Q521), surfaced which, echoing Isaiah lxi, 1, describes God in the
age of the Messiah as healing the wounded and reviving the dead. If
this poem is an Essene composition and not a psalm dating to the late
biblical period, it can be said that one out of many hundreds of Qumran
manuscripts definitely testifies to the sect’s belief in bodily
resurrection.
In sum, the portrait of the sectary as it is reflected in his religious
ideas and ideals bears the marks of a fastidious and deeply
committed observance of the Mosaic Law, an overwhelming
assurance of the correctness of his beliefs, and certainty of his own
eventual salvation. But whereas these characteristics may strike
readers today as far too self-confident, one would do well not to
overlook other traits conspicuous, in particular, in the Essenes’ prayers
and hymns, which testify to an absolute dependence on the Almighty
and a total devotion to what was believed to be God’s cause.
For without Thee no way is perfect,
and without Thy will nothing is done.
It is Thou who hast taught all knowledge
and all things come to pass by Thy will.
There is none beside Thee to dispute Thy counsel
or to understand all Thy holy design,
or to contemplate the depth of Thy mysteries
and the power of Thy might.

Who can endure Thy glory,
and what is the son of man
in the midst of Thy wonderful deeds?
What shall one born of woman
be accounted before Thee?
Kneaded from the dust,
his abode is the nourishment of worms.
He is but a shape, but moulded clay,
and inclines towards dust.
(IQS XI, 17-22)

Note on This Translation
The purpose of this translation is to enable the reader to come into
direct contact with the literary works found at Qumran. The English
does not follow slavishly the Hebrew and Aramaic originals but aims at
being faithful, intelligible and as far as possible readable. For this
reason the Hebrew word order had to be altered and the numbering of
the English lines, which often did not correspond to those of the
manuscript, had to be sacrificed. However, since the 1995 fourth
Penguin edition, every fifth line of the manuscript has been indicated in
the margin of the translation.
As stated in the preface, only meaningful texts are included in this
volume, with the occasional exception of some broken lines which
nevertheless reveal important information. When the same writing is
extant in several manuscripts, the translation either represents a
composite text, or indicates significant variants, but identical
passages are not normally repeated. Experts are referred to the DJD
volumes.
Lacunae impossible to complete with any measure of confidence
are indicated by dots in the translation. Texts supplied from a different
manuscript of the same document appear between { }. Hypothetical
but likely reconstructions are placed between [ ] and glosses
necessary for fluency between ( ). Biblical quotations appearing in the
text are printed in italics, as well as the titles and headings which figure
in the manuscripts. Each scroll is divided into columns. The beginning
of each of these columns is indicated in the translation by bold Roman
numerals: I, II, III, etc. The word vacat indicates an empty space in the
manuscript.
Finally, I wish to acknowledge here the considerable debt we all owe
to J. T. Milik and J. Strugnell for their pioneering decipherment of many
of the Cave 4 texts.

The Community Rule
(IQS, 4Q255-64, 4Q280, 286-7, 4Q502, 5QII, 13)
Discovered in Cave I, the eleven relatively well-preserved columns of
this manuscript (IQS) were first published in 1951 by M. Burrows under
the title The Manual of Discipline (The Dead Sea Scrolls of St Mark’s
Monastery, II, New Haven). Important fragments of ten other
manuscripts of the Rule containing a certain number of variant
readings were also found in Cave 4 (4QSa-j = 4Q255-64), and two
small fragments in Cave 5(5Q11=1QS II, 4-7 and 13 quoting 1QS III, 4-
5 and II, 19). Other citations of the Community Rule, especially the
penal code from 1QS VII, may be found in the 4Q fragments of the
Damascus Document (cf. 4Q266, fr. 10 and 270, fr. 7) and in the
hybrid S-D (4Q265). The latter quotes also from 1QS IV, VI and VIII,
Finally, 4Q502, fr. 16 includes a quotation from 1QS IV, 4-6. See also
11Q29 in DJD, XXIII, 433-4, quoting 1QS VII, 23.
The 1Q manuscript bears the stamp of editorial modification. For
instance, in column x the original ‘I will conceal knowledge with
discretion’ is corrected to ‘I will impart knowledge with discretion’. The
section covered by columns VIII-IX was particularly subjected to
alteration as indicated by corrections and interlinear additions in 1QS,
but remarkably none of these appears in the 4QS manuscripts. The
same section is considerably abridged in 4QSe=4Q259, where the
text jumps from 1QS VIII, 15 directly to ix, 12.
The Community Rule is probably one of the oldest documents of the
sect; its composition may have originated around 100 BCE, and the
Cave I copy itself is said to have been produced during the quarter of a
century following that date. It seems to have been intended for the
Community’s teachers, for its Masters or Guardians, and contains
extracts from liturgical ceremonies, an outline of a tractate on the


---

## Page 128

spirits of truth and falsehood, statutes concerned with initiation into the
sect and with its common life, organization and discipline, a penal
code, and finally a poetic dissertation on the fundamental religious
duties of the Master and his disciples, and on the sacred seasons
proper to the Community.
Literary analysis suggests that the main document begins at 1QS v,
1. This is where 4QSd (=4Q258) starts. The preceding columns in 1QS
I-IV prefix to the Rule proper a liturgical text (1QS 1, I-III, 11) and the
probably independent tractate on the two spirits (1QS III, 12-IV, 25).
Among the 4Q manuscripts only 4QSb (=4Q256) contains remnants of
all the sections of 1QS. The other documents represent either 1QS I-IV
or 1QS V-XI. 4QSe (4Q259) substitutes, it seems, the text of 4QOtot
(4Q319) for that of 1QS X-XI.
There are, to my knowledge, no writings in ancient Jewish sources
parallel to the Community Rule, but a similar type of literature
flourished among Christians between the second and fourth centuries,
the so-called ‘Church Orders’ represented by works such as the
Didache, the Didascalia, the Apostolic Constitution.
The contents of 1QS may be divided into three main sections, but
further subheadings appear in the text itself:
1. Entry into the Covenant, followed by an instruction on the two
spirits (I-IV).
2. Statutes relating to the Council of the Community (V-IX).
3. Directives addressed to the Master, and the Master’s Hymn
(IX-XI).
Some of the variant readings appearing in the Cave 4 manuscripts
have been adopted in this translation, but the significantly different
texts of 4QSd (4Q258) and 4QSe (4Q259) will be appended to 1QS.
For the editio princeps of 1QS, see M. Burrows et al., The Dead
Sea Scrolls of St Mark’s Monastery Vol.II, Fasc. 2:Plates and
transcription of the Manual of Discipline, 1951. Cf. also J. H.

1QS
I [The Master shall teach the sai]nts to live(?) {according to the Book}
(4Q255, 257) of the Community [Rul]e, that they may seek God with a
whole heart and soul, and do what is good and right before Him as He
commanded by the hand of Moses and all His servants the Prophets;
that they may love all that He has chosen and hate all that He has
rejected; that they may abstain from all evil and hold fast to all good;
that they may practise truth, righteousness, and justice upon earth and
no longer stubbornly follow a sinful heart and lustful eyes, committing all
manner of evil. He shall admit into the Covenant of Grace all those who
have freely devoted themselves to the observance of God’s precepts,
that they may be joined to the counsel of God and may live perfectly
before Him in accordance with all that has been revealed concerning
their appointed times, and that they may love all the sons of light, each
according to his lot in God’s design, and hate all the sons of darkness,
each according to his guilt in God’s vengeance.
All those who freely devote themselves to His truth shall bring all their
knowledge, powers and possessions into the Community of God, that
they may purify their knowledge in the truth of God’s precepts and
order their powers according to His ways of perfection and all their
possessions according to His righteous counsel. They shall not depart
from any command of God concerning their times; they shall be neither
early nor late for any of their appointed times, they shall stray neither to
the right nor to the left of any of His true precepts. All those who
embrace the Community Rule shall enter into the Covenant before God
to obey all His commandments so that they may not abandon Him
during the dominion of Belial because of fear or terror or affliction.
On entering the Covenant, the Priests and Levites shall bless the
God of salvation and all His faithfulness, and all those entering the
Covenant shall say after them, ‘Amen, Amen!’
Then the Priests shall recite the favours of God manifested in His
mighty deeds and shall declare all His merciful grace to Israel, and the
Levites shall recite the iniquities of the children of Israel, all their guilty
rebellions and sins during the dominion of Belial. And after them, all


---

## Page 130

those entering the Covenant shall confess and say: ‘We have strayed!
We have [disobeyed!] We and our fathers before us have sinned and
acted wickedly in walking [counter to the precepts] of truth and
righteousness. [And God has] judged us and our fathers also; II but He
has bestowed His bountiful mercy on us from everlasting to
everlasting.’ And the Priests shall bless all the men of the lot of God
who walk perfectly in all His ways, saying: ‘May He bless you with all
good and preserve you from all evil! May He lighten your heart with life-
giving wisdom and grant you eternal knowledge! May He raise His
merciful face towards you for everlasting bliss!’
And the Levites shall curse all the men of the lot of Belial, saying: ‘Be
cursed because of all your guilty wickedness! May He deliver you up
for torture at the hands of the vengeful Avengers! May He visit you with
destruction by the hand of all the Wreakers of Revenge! Be cursed
without mercy because of (4Q256) the darkness of your deeds! Be
damned in the shadowy place of everlasting fire! May God not heed
when you call on Him, nor pardon you by blotting out your sin! May He
raise His angry face towards you for vengeance! May there be no
“Peace” for you in the mouth of those who hold fast to the Fathers!’
And after the blessing and the cursing, all those entering the Covenant
shall say, ‘Amen, Amen!’
And the Priests and Levites shall continue, saying: ‘Cursed be the
man who enters this Covenant while walking among the idols of his
heart, who sets up before himself his stumbling-block of sin so that he
may backslide! Hearing the words of this Covenant, he blesses
himself in his heart and says, “Peace be with me, even though I walk in
the stubbornness of my heart” (Deut. xxix, 18-19), whereas his spirit,
parched (for lack of truth) and watered (with lies), shall be destroyed
without pardon. God’s wrath and His zeal for His precepts shall
consume him in everlasting destruction. All the curses of the Covenant
shall cling to him and God will set him apart for evil. He shall be cut off
from the midst of all the sons of light, and because he has turned aside
from God on account of his idols and his stumbling-block of sin, his lot
shall be among those who are cursed for ever.’ And after them, all
those entering the Covenant shall answer and say, ‘Amen, Amen!’
Thus shall they do, year by year, for as long as the dominion of Belial


---

## Page 131

endures. The Priests shall enter first, ranked one after another
according to the perfection of their spirit; then the Levites; and thirdly,
all the people one after another in their Thousands, Hundreds, Fifties,
and Tens, that every Israelite may know his place in the Community of
God according to the everlasting design. No man shall move down
from his place nor move up from his allotted position. For according to
the holy design, they shall all of them be in a Community of truth and
virtuous humility, of loving-kindness and good intent one towards the
other, and (they shall all of them be) sons of the everlasting Company.
No man [shall be in the] Community of His truth who refuses to enter
[the Covenant of] God so that he may walk in the stubbornness of his
heart, for III his soul detests the wise teaching of just laws. He shall not
be counted among the upright for he has not persisted in the
conversion of his life. His knowledge, powers, and possessions shall
not enter the Council of the Community, for whoever ploughs the mud
of wickedness returns defiled (?). He shall not be justified by that which
his stubborn heart declares lawful, for seeking the ways of light he
looks towards darkness. He shall not be reckoned among the perfect;
he shall neither be purified by atonement, nor cleansed by purifying
waters, nor sanctified by seas and rivers, nor washed clean with any
ablution. Unclean, unclean shall he be. For as long as he despises the
precepts of God he shall receive no instruction in the Community of His
counsel.
For it is through the spirit of true counsel concerning the ways of man
that all his sins shall be expiated, that he may contemplate the light of
life. He shall be cleansed from all his sins by the spirit of holiness
uniting him to His truth, and his iniquity shall be expiated by the spirit of
uprightness and humility. And when his flesh is sprinkled with purifying
water and sanctified by cleansing water, it shall be made clean by the
humble submission of his soul to all the precepts of God. Let him then
order his steps {to walk} (4Q255) perfectly in all the ways commanded
by God concerning the times appointed for him, straying neither to the
right nor to the left and transgressing none of His words, and he shall
be accepted by virtue of a pleasing atonement before God and it shall
be to him a Covenant of the everlasting Community.

## Page 132

The Master shall instruct all the sons of light and shall teach them the
nature of all the children of men according to the kind of spirit which
they possess, the signs identifying their works during their lifetime,
their visitation for chastisement, and the time of their reward.
From the God of Knowledge comes all that is and shall be. Before
ever they existed He established their whole design, and when, as
ordained for them, they come into being, it is in accord with His
glorious design that they accomplish their task without change. The
laws of all things are in His hand and He provides them with all their
needs.
He has created man to govern the world, and has appointed for him
two spirits in which to walk until the time of His visitation: the spirits of
truth and injustice. Those born of truth spring from a fountain of light,
but those born of injustice spring from a source of darkness. All the
children of righteousness are ruled by the Prince of Light and walk in
the ways of light, but all the children of injustice are ruled by the Angel
of Darkness and walk in the ways of darkness. The Angel of Darkness
leads all the children of righteousness astray, and until his end, all their
sin, iniquities, wickedness, and all their unlawful deeds are caused by
his dominion in accordance with the mysteries of God. Every one of
their chastisements, and every one of the seasons of their distress,
shall be brought about by the rule of his persecution; for all his allotted
spirits seek the overthrow of the sons of light.
But the God of Israel and His Angel of Truth will succour all the sons
of light. For it is He who created the spirits of Light and Darkness and
founded every action upon them and established every deed [upon]
their [ways]. And He loves the one IV everlastingly and delights in its
works for ever; but the counsel of the other He loathes and for ever
hates its ways.
These are their ways in the world for the enlightenment of the heart
of man, and so that all the paths of true righteousness may be made
straight before him, and so that the fear of the laws of God may be
instilled in his heart: a spirit of humility, patience, abundant charity,
unending goodness, understanding, and intelligence; (a spirit of)
mighty wisdom which trusts in all the deeds of God and leans on His
great loving-kindness; a spirit of discernment in every purpose, of zeal


---

## Page 133

for just laws, of holy intent with steadfastness of heart, of great charity
towards all the sons of truth, of admirable purity which detests all
unclean idols, of humble conduct sprung from an understanding of all
things, and of faithful concealment of the mysteries of truth. These are
the counsels of the spirit to the sons of truth in this world.
And as for the visitation of all who walk in this spirit, it shall be
healing, great peace in a long life, and fruitfulness, together with every
everlasting blessing and eternal joy in life without end, a crown of glory
and a garment of majesty in unending light.
But the ways of the spirit of falsehood are these: greed, and
slackness in the search for righteousness, wickedness and lies,
haughtiness and pride, falseness and deceit, cruelty and abundant evil,
ill-temper and much folly and brazen insolence, abominable deeds
(committed) in a spirit of lust, and ways of lewdness in the service of
uncleanness, a blaspheming tongue, blindness of eye and dullness of
ear, stiffness of neck and heaviness of heart, so that man walks in all
the ways of darkness and guile.
And the visitation of all who walk in this spirit shall be a multitude of
plagues by the hand of all the destroying angels, everlasting damnation
by the avenging wrath of the fury of God, eternal torment and endless
disgrace together with shameful extinction in the fire of the dark
regions. The times of all their generations shall be spent in sorrowful
mourning and in bitter misery and in calamities of darkness until they
are destroyed without remnant or survivor.
The nature of all the children of men is ruled by these (two spirits),
and during their life all the hosts of men have a portion of their divisions
and walk in (both) their ways. And the whole reward for their deeds
shall be, for everlasting ages, according to whether each man’s portion
in their two divisions is great or small. For God has established the
spirits in equal measure until the final age, and has set everlasting
hatred between their divisions. Truth abhors the works of injustice, and
injustice hates all the ways of truth. And their struggle is fierce in all
their arguments for they do not walk together. But in the mysteries of
His understanding, and in His glorious wisdom, God has ordained an
end for injustice, and at the time of the visitation He will destroy it for
ever. Then truth, which has wallowed in the ways of wickedness during


---

## Page 134

the dominion of injustice until the appointed time of judgement, shall
arise in the world for ever. God will then purify every deed of man with
His truth; He will refine for Himself the human frame by rooting out all
spirit of injustice from the bounds of his flesh. He will cleanse him of all
wicked deeds with the spirit of holiness; like purifying waters He will
shed upon him the spirit of truth (to cleanse him) of all abomination and
injustice. And he shall be plunged into the spirit of purification, that he
may instruct the upright in the knowledge of the Most High and teach
the wisdom of the sons of heaven to the perfect of way. For God has
chosen them for an everlasting Covenant and all the glory of Adam
shall be theirs. There shall be no more lies and all the works of injustice
shall be put to shame.
Until now the spirits of truth and injustice struggle in the hearts of
men and they walk in both wisdom and folly. According to his portion of
truth so does a man hate injustice, and according to his inheritance in
the realm of injustice so is he wicked and so hates truth. For God has
established the two spirits in equal measure until the determined end,
and until the Renewal, and He knows the reward of their deeds from all
eternity. He has allotted them to the children of men that they may know
good [and evil, and] that the destiny of all the living may be according
to the spirit within [them at the time] of the visitation.
V And this is the Rule for the men of the Community who have
freely pledged themselves to be converted from all evil and to
cling to all His commandments according to His will
They shall separate from the congregation of the men of injustice
and shall unite, with respect to the Law and possessions, under the
authority of the sons of Zadok, the Priests who keep the Covenant, and
of the multitude of the men of the Community who hold fast to the
Covenant. Every decision concerning doctrine, property, and justice
shall be determined by them.
They shall practise truth and humility in common, and justice and
uprightness and charity and modesty in all their ways. No man shall
walk in the stubbornness of his heart so that he strays after his heart


---

## Page 135

and eyes and evil inclination, but he shall circumcise in the Community
the foreskin of evil inclination and of stiffness of neck that they may lay
a foundation of truth for Israel, for the Community of the everlasting
Covenant. They shall atone for all those in Aaron who have freely
pledged themselves to holiness, and for those in Israel who have freely
pledged themselves to the House of Truth, and for those who join them
to live in community and to take part in the trial and judgement and
condemnation of all those who transgress the precepts.
On joining the Community, this shall be their code of behaviour with
respect to all these precepts.
Whoever approaches the Council of the Community shall enter the
Covenant of God in the presence of all who have freely pledged
themselves. He shall undertake by a binding oath to return with all his
heart and soul to every commandment of the Law of Moses in
accordance with all that has been revealed of it to the sons of Zadok,
the Priests, Keepers of the Covenant and Seekers of His will, and to
the multitude of the men of their Covenant who together have freely
pledged themselves to His truth and to walking in the way of His
delight. And he shall undertake by the Covenant to separate from all
the men of injustice who walk in the way of wickedness.
For they are not reckoned in His Covenant. They have neither
inquired nor sought after Him concerning His laws that they might know
the hidden things in which they have sinfully erred; and matters
revealed they have treated with insolence. Therefore Wrath shall rise
up to condemn, and Vengeance shall be executed by the curses of the
Covenant, and great chastisements of eternal destruction shall be
visited on them, leaving no remnant. They shall not enter the water to
partake of the pure Meal of the men of holiness, for they shall not be
cleansed unless they turn from their wickedness: for all who transgress
His word are unclean. Likewise, no man shall consort with him in
regard to his work or property lest he be burdened with the guilt of his
sin. He shall indeed keep away from him in all things: as it is written,
Keep away from all that is false (Exod. xxiii, 7). No member of the
Community shall follow them in matters of doctrine and justice, or eat
or drink anything of theirs, or take anything from them except for a
price; as it is written, Keep away from the man in whose nostrils is


---

## Page 136

breath, for wherein is he counted? (Isa. ii, 22). For all those not
reckoned in His Covenant are to be set apart, together with all that is
theirs. None of the men of holiness shall lean upon works of vanity: for
they are all vanity who know not His Covenant, and He will blot from the
world all them that despise His word. All their deeds are defilement
before Him, and all their property unclean.
But when a man enters the Covenant to walk according to all these
precepts that he may be joined to the holy Congregation, they shall
examine his spirit in community with respect to his understanding and
practice of the Law, under the authority of the sons of Aaron who have
freely pledged themselves in the Community to restore His Covenant
and to heed all the precepts commanded by Him, and of the multitude
of Israel who have freely pledged themselves in the Community to
return to His Covenant. They shall inscribe them in order, one after
another, according to their understanding and their deeds, that every
one may obey his companion, the man of lesser rank obeying his
superior. And they shall examine their spirit and deeds yearly, so that
each man may be advanced in accordance with his understanding and
perfection of way, or moved down in accordance with his distortions.
They shall rebuke one another in truth, humility, and charity. Let no man
address his companion with anger, or ill-temper, or obdu[racy, or with
envy prompted by (4Q258)] the spirit of wickedness. Let him not hate
him [because of his uncircumcised] heart, but let him rebuke him on
the very same day lest VI he incur guilt because of him. And
furthermore, let no man accuse his companion before the
Congregation without having admonished him in the presence of
witnesses.
These are the ways in which all of them shall walk, each man with his
companion, wherever they dwell. The man of lesser rank shall obey the
greater in matters of work and money. They shall eat in common and
bless in common and deliberate in common.
Wherever there are ten men of the Council of the Community there
shall not lack a Priest among them. And they shall all sit before him
according to their rank and shall be asked their counsel in all things in
that order. And when the table has been prepared for eating, and the
new wine for drinking, the Priest shall be the first to stretch out his hand


---

## Page 137

to bless the firstfruits of the bread and new wine.
And where the ten are, there shall never lack a man among them
who shall study the Law continually, day and night, concerning the right
conduct of a man with his companion. And the Congregation shall
watch in community for a third of every night of the year, to read the
Book and to study the Law and to bless together.
This is the Rule for an Assembly of the Congregation
Each man shall sit in his place: the Priests shall sit first, and the
elders second, and all the rest of the people according to their rank.
And thus shall they be questioned concerning the Law, and concerning
any counsel or matter coming before the Congregation, each man
bringing his knowledge to the Council of the Community.
No man shall interrupt a companion before his speech has ended,
nor speak before a man of higher rank; each man shall speak in his
turn. And in an Assembly of the Congregation no man shall speak
without the consent of the Congregation, nor indeed of the Guardian of
the Congregation. Should any man wish to speak to the Congregation,
yet not be in a position to question the Council of the Community, let
him rise to his feet and say: ‘I have something to say to the
Congregation.’ If they command him to speak, he shall speak.
Every man, born of Israel, who freely pledges himself to join the
Council of the Community shall be examined by the Guardian at the
head of the Congregation concerning his understanding and his
deeds. If he is fitted to the discipline, he shall admit him into the
Covenant that he may be converted to the truth and depart from all
injustice; and he shall instruct him in all the rules of the Community. And
later, when he comes to stand before the Congregation, they shall all
deliberate his case, and according to the decision of the Council of the
Congregation he shall either enter or depart. After he has entered the
Council of the Community he shall not touch the pure Meal of the
Congregation until one {full} (4Q256) year is completed, and until he
has been examined concerning his spirit and deeds; nor shall he have
any share of the property of the Congregation. Then when he has


---

## Page 138

completed one year within the Community, the Congregation shall
deliberate his case with regard to his understanding and observance
of the Law. And if it be his destiny, according to the judgement of the
Priests and the multitude of the men of their Covenant, to enter the
company of the Community, his property and earnings shall be handed
over to the Bursar of the Congregation who shall register it to his
account and shall not spend it for the Congregation. He shall not touch
the Drink of the Congregation until he has completed a second year
among the men of the Community. But when the second year has
passed, he shall be examined, and if it be his destiny, according to the
judgement of the Congregation, to enter the Community, then he shall
be inscribed among his brethren in the order of his rank for the Law,
and for justice, and for the pure Meal; his property shall be merged and
he shall offer his counsel and judgement to the Community.
These are the Rules by which they shall judge at a Community
(Court of) Inquiry according to the cases
If one of them has lied deliberately in matters of property, he shall be
excluded from the pure Meal of the Congregation for one year and
shall do penance with respect to one quarter of his food.
Whoever has answered his companion with obstinacy, or has
addressed him impatiently, going so far as to take no account of the
dignity of his fellow by disobeying the order of a brother inscribed
before him, he has taken the law into his own hand; therefore he shall
do penance for one year [and shall be excluded].
If any man has uttered the [Most] Venerable Name VII even though
frivolously, or as a result of shock or for any other reason whatever,
while reading the Book or blessing, he shall be dismissed and shall
return to the Council of the Community no more.
If he has spoken in anger against one of the Priests inscribed in the
Book, he shall do penance for one year and shall be excluded for his
soul’s sake from the pure Meal of the Congregation. But if he has
spoken unwittingly, he shall do penance for six months.
Whoever has deliberately lied shall do penance for six months.


---

## Page 139

Whoever has deliberately insulted his companion unjustly shall do
penance for one year and shall be excluded.
Whoever has deliberately deceived his companion by word or by
deed shall do penance for six months.
If he has failed to care for his companion, he shall do penance for
three months. But if he has failed to care for the property of the
Community, thereby causing its loss, he shall restore it in full. And if he
be unable to restore it, he shall do penance for sixty days.
Whoever has borne malice against his companion unjustly shall do
penance for six months/one year; and likewise, whoever has taken
revenge in any matter whatever.
Whoever has spoken foolishly: three months.
Whoever has interrupted his companion whilst speaking: ten days.
Whoever has lain down to sleep during an Assembly of the
Congregation : thirty days. And likewise, whoever has left, without
reason, an Assembly of the Congregation as many as three times
during one Assembly, shall do penance for ten days. But if he has
departed whilst they were standing he shall do penance for thirty days.
Whoever has gone naked before his companion, without having
been obliged to do so, he shall do penance for six months.
Whoever has spat in an Assembly of the Congregation shall do
penance for thirty days.
Whoever has been so poorly dressed that when drawing his hand
from beneath his garment his nakedness has been seen, he shall do
penance for thirty days.
Whoever has guffawed foolishly shall do penance for thirty days.
Whoever has drawn out his left hand to gesticulate with it shall do
penance for ten days.
Whoever has gone about slandering his companion shall be
excluded from the pure Meal of the Congregation for one year and
shall do penance. But whoever has slandered the Congregation shall
be expelled from among them and shall return no more.
Whoever has murmured against the authority of the Community shall
be expelled and shall not return. But if he has murmured against his
companion unjustly, he shall do penance for six months.
Should a man return whose spirit has so trembled before the


---

## Page 140

authority of the Community that he has betrayed the truth and walked in
the stubbornness of his heart, he shall do penance for two years.
During the first year he shall not touch the pure Meal of the
Congregation, and during the second year he shall not touch the Drink
of the Congregation and shall sit below all the men of the Community.
Then when his two years are completed, the Congregation shall
consider his case, and if he is admitted he shall be inscribed in his
rank and may then question concerning the Law.
If, after being in the Council of the Community for ten full years, the
spirit of any man has failed, so that he has betrayed the Community
and departed from the Congregation to walk in the stubbornness of his
heart, he shall return no more to the Council of the Community.
Moreover, if any member of the Community has shared with him his
food or property which ... of the Congregation, his sentence shall be
the same; he shall be ex[pelled].
VIII In the Council of the Community there shall be twelve men and
three Priests, perfectly versed in all that is revealed of the Law, whose
works shall be truth, righteousness, justice, loving-kindness and
humility. They shall preserve the faith in the Land with steadfastness
and meekness and shall atone for sin by the practice of justice and by
suffering the sorrows of affliction. They shall walk with all men
according to the standard of truth and the rule of the time.
When these are in Israel, the Council of the Community shall be
established in truth. It shall be an Everlasting Plantation, a House of
Holiness for Israel, an Assembly of Supreme Holiness for Aaron. They
shall be witnesses to the truth at the Judgement, and shall be the elect
of Goodwill who shall atone for the Land and pay to the wicked their
reward. It shall be that tried wall, that precious corner-stone, whose
foundations shall neither rock nor sway in their place (Isa. xxviii, 16). It
shall be a Most Holy Dwelling for Aaron, with everlasting knowledge of
the Covenant of justice, and shall offer up sweet fragrance. It shall be a
House of Perfection and Truth in Israel that they may establish a
Covenant according to the everlasting precepts. And they shall be an
agreeable offering, atoning for the Land and determining the
judgement of wickedness, and there shall be no more iniquity. When


---

## Page 141

they have been confirmed for two years in perfection of way in the
Foundation of the Community, they shall be set apart as holy within the
Council of the men of the Community. And the Interpreter shall not
conceal from them, out of fear of the spirit of apostasy, any of those
things hidden from Israel which have been discovered by him.
And when these become members of the Community in Israel
according to all these rules, they shall separate from the habitation of
unjust men and shall go into the wilderness to prepare there the way of
Him; as it is written, Prepare in the wilderness the way of ... , make
straight in the desert a path for our God (Isa. xl, 3). This (path) is the
study of the Law which He commanded by the hand of Moses, that they
may do according to all that has been revealed from age to age, and
as the Prophets have revealed by His Holy Spirit.
And no man among the members of the Covenant of the Community
who deliberately, on any point whatever, turns aside from all that is
commanded, shall touch the pure Meal of the men of holiness or know
anything of their counsel until his deeds are purified from all injustice
and he walks in perfection of way. And then, according to the
judgement of the Congregation, he shall be admitted to the Council
and shall be inscribed in his rank. This rule shall apply to whoever
enters the Community.
And these are the rules which the men of perfect holiness shall
follow in their commerce with one another
Every man who enters the Council of Holiness, (the Council of those)
who walk in the way of perfection as commanded by God, and who
deliberately or through negligence transgresses one word of the Law
of Moses, on any point whatever, shall be expelled from the Council of
the Community and shall return no more; no man of holiness shall be
associated in his property or counsel in any matter at all. But if he has
acted inadvertently, he shall be excluded from the pure Meal and the
Council and they shall interpret the rule (as follows). For two years he
shall take no part in judgement or ask for counsel; but if, during that
time, his way becomes perfect, {then he shall return) (4Q258) to the


---

## Page 142

(Court of) Inquiry and the Council, in accordance with the judgement of
the Congregation, provided that he commit no further inadvertent sin
during two full years. IX For one sin of inadvertence (alone) he shall do
penance for two years. But as for him who has sinned deliberately, he
shall never return; only the man who has sinned inadvertently shall be
tried for two years, that his way and counsel may be made perfect
according to the judgement of the Congregation. And afterwards, he
shall be inscribed in his rank in the Community of Holiness.
When these become members of the Community in Israel according
to all these rules, they shall establish the spirit of holiness according to
everlasting truth. They shall atone for guilty rebellion and for sins of
unfaithfulness, that they may obtain loving-kindness for the Land
without the flesh of holocausts and the fat of sacrifice. And prayer
rightly offered shall be as an acceptable fragrance of righteousness,
and perfection of way as a delectable free-will offering. At that time, the
men of the Community shall set apart a House of Holiness in order that
it may be united to the most holy things and a House of Community for
Israel, for those who walk in perfection. The sons of Aaron alone shall
command in matters of justice and property, and every rule concerning
the men of the Community shall be determined according to their word.
As for the property of the men of holiness who walk in perfection, it
shall not be merged with that of the men of injustice who have not
purified their life by separating themselves from iniquity and walking in
the way of perfection. They shall depart from none of the counsels of
the Law to walk in all the stubbornness of their hearts, but shall be ruled
by the primitive precepts in which the men of the Community were first
instructed until there shall come the Prophet and the Messiahs of
Aaron and Israel.
These are the precepts in which the Master shall walk in His
commerce with all the living, according to the rule proper to
every season and according to the worth of every man
He shall do the will of God according to all that has been revealed
from age to age.


---

## Page 143

He shall measure out all knowledge discovered throughout the ages,
together with the Precept of the age.
He shall separate and weigh the sons of righteousness according to
their spirit.
He shall hold firmly to the elect of the time according to His will, as
He has commanded.
He shall judge every man according to his spirit. He shall admit him
in accordance with the cleanness of his hands and advance him in
accordance with his understanding. And he shall love and hate
likewise.
He shall not rebuke the men of the Pit nor dispute with them.
He shall conceal the teaching of the Law from men of injustice, but
shall impart true knowledge and righteous judgement to those who
have chosen the Way. He shall guide them all in knowledge according
to the spirit of each and according to the rule of the age, and shall thus
instruct them in the mysteries of marvellous truth, so that in the midst of
the men of the Community they may walk perfectly together in all that
has been revealed to them. This is the time for the preparation of the
way into the wilderness, and he shall teach them to do all that is
required at that time and to separate from all those who have not
turned aside from all injustice.
These are the rules of conduct for the Master in those times with
respect to His loving and hating
Everlasting hatred in a spirit of secrecy for the men of perdition! He
shall leave to them wealth and earnings like a slave to his lord and like
a poor man to his master.
He shall be a man zealous for the Precept whose time is for the Day
of Revenge. He shall perform the will of God in all his deeds, and in all
his dominion as He has commanded. He shall freely delight in all that
befalls him and nothing shall please him save God’s will. He shall
delight in all the words of His mouth and shall desire nothing except
His command. He shall watch always [for] the judgement of God, and
shall bless his Maker [for all His goodness] and declare [His mercies]


---

## Page 144

in all that befalls.
He shall bless Him [with the offering] of the lips X at the times
ordained by Him: at the beginning of the dominion of light, and at its
end when it retires to its appointed place; at the beginning of the
watches of darkness when He unlocks their storehouse and spreads
them out, and also at their end when they retire before the light; when
the heavenly lights shine out from the dwelling-place of Holiness, and
also when they retire to the place of Glory; at the entry of the (monthly)
seasons on the days of the new moon, and also at their end when they
succeed to one another. Their renewal is a great day for the Holy of
Holies, and a sign for the unlocking of everlasting mercies at the
beginning of seasons in all times to come.
At the beginning of the months of the (yearly) seasons
and on the holy days appointed for remembrance,
in their seasons I will bless Him
with the offering of the lips
according to the Precept engraved for ever:
at the beginning of the years
and at the end of their seasons
when their appointed law is fulfilled,
on the day decreed by Him
that they should pass from one to the other–
the season of early harvest to the summer time,
the season of sowing to the season of grass,
the seasons of years to their weeks (of years)–
and at the beginning of their weeks
for the season of Jubilee.
All my life the engraved Precept shall be on my tongue
as the fruit of praise
and the portion of my lips.
I will sing with knowledge and all my music
shall be for the glory of God.
(My) lyre (and) my harp shall sound
for His holy order
and I will tune the pipe of my lips


---

## Page 145

to His right measure.
With the coming of day and night
I will enter the Covenant of God,
and when evening and morning depart
I will recite His decrees.
I will place in them my bounds without return.
I will declare His judgement concerning my sins,
and my transgressions shall be before my eyes
as an engraved Precept.
I will say to God, ‘My Righteousness’
and ‘Author of my Goodness’ to the Most High,
‘Fountain of Knowledge’ and ‘Source of Holiness’,
‘Summit of Glory’ and ‘Almighty Eternal Majesty’.
I will choose that which He teaches me
and will delight in His judgement of me.
Before I move my hands and feet
I will bless His Name.
I will praise Him before I go out or enter,
or sit or rise,
and whilst I lie on the couch of my bed.
I will bless Him with the offering
of that which proceeds from my lips
from the midst of the ranks of men,
and before I lift my hands to eat
of the pleasant fruits of the earth.
I will bless Him for His exceeding wonderful deeds
at the beginning of fear and dread
and in the abode of distress and desolation.
I will meditate on His power
and will lean on His mercies all day long.
I know that judgement of all the living
is in His hand,
and that all His deeds are truth.
I will praise Him when distress is unleashed


---

## Page 146

and will magnify Him also because of His salvation.
I will pay to no man the reward of evil;
I will pursue him with goodness.
For judgement of all the living is with God
and it is He who will render to man his reward.
I will not envy in a spirit of wickedness,
my soul shall not desire the riches of violence.
I will not grapple with the men of perdition
until the Day of Revenge,
but my wrath shall not turn from the men of falsehood
and I will not rejoice until judgement is made.
I will bear no rancour
against them that turn from transgression,
but will have no pity
on all who depart from the way.
I will offer no comfort to the smitten
until their way becomes perfect.
I will not keep Belial within my heart,
and in my mouth shall be heard
no folly or sinful deceit,
no cunning or lies shall be found on my lips.
The fruit of holiness shall be on my tongue
and no abominations shall be found upon it.
I will open my mouth
in songs of thanksgiving,
and my tongue shall always proclaim
the goodness of God and the sin of men
until their transgression ends.
I will cause vanities
to cease from my lips,
uncleanness and crookedness
from the knowledge of my heart.
I will impart/conceal knowledge with discretion


---

## Page 147

and will prudently hedge it within a firm bound
to preserve faith and strong judgement
in accordance with the justice of God.
I will distribute the Precept
by the measuring-cord of the times,
and ... righteousness
and loving-kindness towards the oppressed,
encouragement to the troubled heart
XI and discernment to the erring spirit,
teaching understanding to them that murmur
that they may answer meekly
before the haughty of spirit
and humbly before men of injustice
who point the finger and speak of iniquity
and who are zealous for wealth.
As for me,
my justification is with God.
In His hand are the perfection of my way
and the uprightness of my heart.
He will wipe out my transgression
through His righteousness.
For my light has sprung
from the source of His knowledge;
my eyes have beheld His marvellous deeds,
and the light of my heart, the mystery to come.
He that is everlasting
is the support of my right hand;
the way of my steps is over stout rock
which nothing shall shake;
for the rock of my steps is the truth of God
and His might is the support of my right hand.
From the source of His righteousness
is my justification,


---

## Page 148

and from His marvellous mysteries
is the light in my heart.
My eyes have gazed
on that which is eternal,
on wisdom concealed from men,
on knowledge and wise design
(hidden) from the sons of men;
on a fountain of righteousness
and on a storehouse of power,
on a spring of glory
(hidden) from the assembly of flesh.
God has given them to His chosen ones
as an everlasting possession,
and has caused them to inherit
the lot of the Holy Ones.
He has joined their assembly
to the Sons of Heaven
to be a Council of the Community,
a foundation of the Building of Holiness,
and eternal Plantation throughout all ages to come.
As for me,
I belong to wicked mankind,
to the company of unjust flesh.
My iniquities, rebellions, and sins,
together with the perversity of my heart,
belong to the company of worms
and to those who walk in darkness.
For mankind has no way,
and man is unable to establish his steps
since justification is with God
and perfection of way is out of His hand.
All things come to pass by His knowledge;
He establishes all things by His design
and without Him nothing is done.


---

## Page 149

As for me,
if I stumble, the mercies of God
shall be my eternal salvation.
If I stagger because of the sin of flesh,
my justification shall be
by the righteousness of God which endures for ever.
When my distress is unleashed
He will deliver my soul from the Pit
and will direct my steps to the way.
He will draw me near by His grace,
and by His mercy will He bring my justification.
He will judge me in the righteousness of His truth
and in the greatness of His goodness
He will pardon all my sins.
Through His righteousness he will cleanse me
of the uncleanness of man
and of the sins of the children of men,
that I may confess to God His righteousness,
and His majesty to the Most High.
Blessed art Thou, my God,
who openest the heart of Thy servant to knowledge!
Establish all his deeds in righteousness,
and as it pleases Thee to do for the elect of mankind,
grant that the son of Thy handmaid
may stand before Thee for ever.
For without Thee no way is perfect,
and without Thy will nothing is done.
It is Thou who hast taught all knowledge
and all things come to pass by Thy will.
There is none beside Thee to dispute Thy counsel
or to understand all Thy holy design,
or to contemplate the depth of Thy mysteries
and the power of Thy might.


---

## Page 150

Who can endure Thy glory,
and what is the son of man
in the midst of Thy wonderful deeds?
What shall one born of woman
be accounted before Thee?
Kneaded from the dust,
his abode is the nourishment of worms.
He is but a shape, but moulded clay,
and inclines towards dust.
What shall hand-moulded clay reply?
What counsel shall it understand?

Community Rule manuscripts from Cave 4
4QSd=4Q258
This‘is the best preserved of the ten 4QS manuscripts. Seven columns
of the text have survived, five of them containing full-length lines.
Column 1, with a wide margin on the right, is almost certainly the
beginning of the Scroll. It corresponds to 1QS v, 1. The last identifiable
passage represents 1QS XI, 7. The word ‘God’ (‘el) is written twice
with palaeo-Hebrew letters (at 1QS IX, 25 and x, 9). Columns I and II of
Sd (1QS v, I-VI, 7) provide a shorter and smoother version of the Rule
than 1QS. The more fragmentary 4QSb (=4Q256) supports the present
version on the essential points. The most significant peculiarities of
4QSd (=4Q258) are the almost complete absence of the ‘full’ spelling
characteristic of the Qumran sectarian manuscripts, the different
opening line and a repeated failure to mention ‘the Priests, the Sons of
Zadok’. For both its occurrences in 1QS, 4QSd (and 4QSb) read ‘the
Congregation’ (ha-rabbim), an alternative reading likely to possess
important historical implications.
For the editio princeps, see P. S. Alexander and G. Vermes, DJD,
XXVI, 83-128. See also G. Vermes, ‘The Leadership of the Qumran
Community: Sons of Zadok - Priests - Congregation’, in the Martin
Hengel Festschrift Geschichte-Tradition-Reflexion, ed. P. Schäfer

I (=1QS v, I-20) Teaching for the Master concerning the men of the Law
(or: the Master who is the superior of the men of the Law) who have
freely pledged themselves to convert from all evil and hold fast to all
that He has commanded. And they shall separate from the
congregation of the men of injustice and shall unite with respect to
doctrine and property, and they shall be under the authority of the

## Page 152

Congregation concerning all matters of doctrine and property. They
shall practise humility and righteousness and justice and loving-
[kindness] and modesty in all their ways. And no man shall walk in the
stubbornness of his heart so as to stray. He is rather to lay [a
foundation] of truth for Israel for the Community, for all those who have
freely pledged themselves to Holiness in Aaron and to a House of
Truth in Israel and for those who jo[in th]em for a Community. Whoever
enters the Council [of the Commu]nity shall undertake by binding (oath)
to [return t]o the Law of Moses with all (his) heart and soul, to all that
has been revealed from the L[aw].
[And whoever enters] the Council of the me[n] of the Communi[ty
shall separate from all the men] of injustice... He shall not touch the
purity of the men [of holine]ss and shall not eat with (them) [in
community. And no] one of the men of the Community [shall follow] their
decision in any [doctrine] and judgement. And ... of work. No one from
the men of holiness shall eat ... [And] they shall not lean upon [work]s of
vanity, for they are all vanity who [do not know His Covenant and all
who despis]e His word He will blot them out from the world. All their
deeds are defileme[nt] be[fore Him and al]l [their property unclean.] ...
Gentiles(?) and they pronounce oaths and execrations and vows. [But
when a man enters the Covenant according to all these precepts, that
he may be joined to the h]oly [Congregation,] they [shall examine their
spirit in community,] am[ong themselves] con[cerning their
understanding] II (1QS v, 21-VI, 7) and their practice of the Law under
the authority of the sons of Aaron who have freely pledged themselves
to restore His Covenant and heed to all the precepts commanded by
Him to be practised by the multitude of Israel who have freely pledged
themselves to return in common. They shall be inscribed in the order,
one after another, each according to his understanding and his deeds
in the Law, that all may obey one another, the man of lesser rank the
greater. And they shall examine their spirit and their deeds in the Law
yearly so that each man may be advanced in accordance with [his]
un[derstanding] or moved down in accordance with his aberrations.
They shall rebuke one another (in) loving-kindness. Let no man
address his companion with anger or ill-temper or wicked envy. Also
let no man accuse his companion before the Congregation without


---

## Page 153

having rebuked him before witnesses. These are the ways in which all
of them shall walk, each man with his companion, wherever they dwell.
[The man of lesser rank] shall ob[ey] the greater in matters of work and
pro[perty. And they shall e]at [in common] and bless in common and
delibera[te] in common. [And wherever there are ten] III (1QS VI, 7-10)
men of [the Council of the Community, there shall not lack] a pri[est
from a]mong them. [And] they [shall sit, each m]an according to his
rank, [before him and shall be asked their counsel in all things in that
order.] And when [the table has been prepared for eating or the n]ew
wine [for drinking, the] priest shall [be first to stretch out his hand to
bless the firstfruit of the bread] and of the wine. [And where the ten are,
there shall never lack a man among them who shall study the Law day
and night. And the Congregation shall w]atch [for one third of every
night of the year, to read the Book] IV ... V (IS VII, 13) ... [and whoever

knowledge of them all of a covenant of justice and of the offering of
fragrance; (it shall be) a house of perfection and truth for Israe]l to
establish a covenant according to the everlasting precepts.
[They shall be an acceptance to atone for the land and to determine
the judgement of wickedness with no injustice (any more). When these
have been confirmed in the fou]ndation of the Community for two
years, [in perfection of way, they shall be separated as holy within the
council of the men] of the Communi[ty. And anything hidden from Is]rael
but discovered by the man [who interprets, he shall not conceal it from
them for fear of the spirit of apostasy.] And when these become (part
of) the Community/in Israel, they shall separate fr[om the midst of the
habitation] of the men [of injustice to go into the wilderness to prepare
there the way of HIM (or: {the truth} (4Q259). This is the study of the
La]w which He has commanded by the ha[nd of Moses, to pra]ctise all
[that has been revealed from age to age, and as the prophets have
revealed by His holy spirit. And no ma]n from the men of the covenant
of the [Community who turns aside from any commandment
deliberately shall touch the purity of the men of holiness, nor shall he

so that he walks in perfection of way. And they shall admit him to the
council by the decision of the Congregation and afterwards he shall be
inscribed in his rank. And this rule (shall apply) to everyone who
attaches himself] to the Community. [And these are the rules which the
men of holiness shall follow, one regarding another.] Everyone who
[enters the council of the Community] ... VII (1QS VII, 24-IX, 10, 15) ...
they shall exclude him from purity and from council and from judgement
for tw[o year]s and he shall return to study and to council if he has not
committed again a sin by inadvertence for two full years. For one sin of
inadvertence he shall do penance for two years, and for a deliberately
committed sin he shall return no more. But he shall be tried for two
[y]ears concerning the perfection of his way and for his counsel
according to the decision of the Congregation and he shall be
inscribed in his rank in the Community of holiness. [When] these
[become part] of the Community in Israel according to these rules, they
shall [es]tablish the spirit of holiness as eternal truth. They shall atone
for guilty rebellion [and the sin of unfaithful]ness and shall gain (divine)
acceptance for the lan[d without the flesh] of holocausts and the fat of
sacrifices and offerings. And the cor[r]ect free-will gift of the lips shall
be like a fragrance [of righteousness and the perfection] of the way like
the free-will offerin[g of a]greeable [tribute]. And at that time they shall
separate a house of Aaron for holiness for all [ ] of God [and a house of
Community for Is]rael who walk in perfe[ction. Only the sons of Aa]ron
[shall comm]a[nd in matters of ju]stice and property. And the property
[of the men of holiness who wa]lk in perfection, let [their property] not
be mer[ged with] the property [of the men of falsehood] who have not
confir[med their way to separate from all] e[vil things] so as to walk in
[the way of perfection. Let them not depart from any counsel of the
Law] and they shall be judged by the [primitive precepts in which the
men of the Community began to be instructed. He shall perform the
judgement of every man according to his spirit and he shall admit him
according to the cleanness of his hands] VIII (1QS IX, 15-x, 3) and
shall advance him according to his understanding, and so shall be his
love and his hatred. Furthermore he shall not rebuke a man and shall
not dispute with the men of the pit. He shall conceal his counsel among


---

## Page 155

the men of injustice, but he shall impart true knowledge and righteous

and truth among the men of the Community that they may walk in
perfection each man with [his fellow in all that has been] revealed to
them. This is the time for the preparation of the way into the
wilderness. He shall instruct them in all that is to be done in that time.
[And he shall separate] from every man who has not turned away
from all injustice. And these are the rules of conduct for the Master in
[those] ti[mes] [with respect to his loving and] hating. Everlasting hatred
for the men of the pit in a spirit of secrecy. He shall leave to them
property and gain [and the earnings of toil like a slave to] his [lo]rd and
the poor man to his master. Each shall be zealous for the precept and
his time shall become a day [of revenge.] He shall [perform the will (of
God) in all his actions and in al]l his dominion a[s He has commanded.
And a]ll that befalls him, he shall enjoy as a free gift and without the will
[of GOD] [he shall not enjoy (anything). He shall delight in all the words
of His mouth and shall desire nothing that He has] n[ot commanded.

bless his Maker and in all that befalls he shall declare [ ] and with the
offering of the lips he shall bless Him at [the times which He has
decreed. At the beginning of the dominion of light a]nd the c[ompletion

[of the watches of darkness. When He opens its storehouse and

holiness together with their withdrawal to the dwelling of glory. At the
entry of seasons according to the new moon as well as their

sign for the opening of the everlasting mercies at the beginning of the
seasons for all ages to come. At the beginning of the months for their

[and at the beginning of] their weeks the seasons of jubilee. And during
all my existence the [en]graved precept shall be on [my tongue as a

all my music is for the glory of GOD. [And I will] strike my lyre to the
order [of His holiness and the pipe of my lips I will] tune to [His r]ight

Most High, ‘A]uthor of my goodness’, ‘Fountain of Knowledge’ and
‘Source of Holiness’, ‘Summit of Glory’ and ‘Almighty Eternal Majesty’.

4QSe=4Q259
Three fragmentary columns of a leather scroll contain damaged
sections of 1QS VII-IX. The text translated comes from columns II and III
and represents an important doctrinal section of 1QS (VIII, 4-IX, II) in an
abridged form. Not only are some of the interlinear additions to 1QS
absent, suggesting their later editorial nature, but 4QSe (4Q259) jumps
from 1QS VIII, 15 to IX, 12, thus omitting among other things the
mention of the ‘Prophet and the Messiahs of Aaron and Israel’ (1QS
IX, II). It would seem that the copyist of this manuscript substituted
4Q319 (the calendric document of Otot) for the text corresponding to
1QS X-XI.
For the editio princeps, see P. S. Alexander and G. Vermes, DJD,
XXVI, 129-52.
II (1QS VII, 20-VIII, 10) ... And when [he has] comple[ted] [two years,
the Congregation shall consider his case and he shall be inscribed in]

anyone who has been in the Co]uncil of the Community until he has
completed [ten years, and then his spirit turned back so that he has
betrayed the Community and has departed from] the Congregation to
walk [in the stubbornness of his heart, he shall return no more to the
Council of the Community. And any of the m]en of the Community who
[has shared with him his purity or his property], his sentence shall be
[like his: he shall be expelled. In the Council of the Community there
shall be twelve m]en [and] three priests, [perfect in all that has been
revealed from the whole Law to practise] truth, righteousness and
justice [loving-kindness and modesty towards one another. They shall
preserve f]aith in the land with steadfastness and with humility [and a

justice and the distress of te]sting. They shall walk with all men[ by the

Council of the Community shall be established [to be an] ever[lasting

Supreme Holiness for Aaron. They shall be witnesses of the truth at the

place (Isa. xxviii, 16). It shall be a m[ost] Holy Dwelling for Aar[on f]or a
Covenan[t of justice to offer up sweet] fragrance. It shall be a House of
Perfection and Truth in [Israel that they may establish a Covenant
according to the everlast]ing [precepts.] When they have been
confirmed III (IQS VIII, 11-15; IX, 12 ...) [for two years in the perfection
of way in the Foundation of the Community, they shall be set apart] as
holy within the Council of the men [of the Community. And] the
interpreter shall not con[c]eal [from them, out of fear of the spirit of
apostasy, any of those things hidden from Israel which have been
discover]ed by him. [And when] these shall become the Community,
they shall separate fro[m the habit]ation [of unjust men and shall] go
into the wil[derness to prepare there th]e way of the Truth; a[s] it is
written, [In the wildernes]s pr[epare the way of... (?), make strai]ght in
the desert a path for our God (Isa. xl, 3). This (path) is [the study of the
Law which] He commanded by the hand of Moses. (The manuscript
omits the section corresponding to 1QS VIII, 15b to ix, 11, and
continues with ix, 12 on the same line.) These are the pre[cepts in
which] the Mas[ter shall walk] in his commerce with all the living,
according to the rule proper to every season and according to the
wort[h of every man].

Entry into the Covenant
(4Q275)
Previously called 4QTohorot Ba, this tiny fragment represents a
document describing the entry into the Covenant, known from the
Community Rule (1QS), and alludes to a festival in the third month, i.e.
the Feast of Weeks of Pentecost, when according to one of the Cave
4 manuscripts of the Damascus Document (4Q266) the Qumran
Covenant renewal took place.
For the editio princeps, see P. S. Alexander and G. Vermes, DJD,
XXVI, 200—16.
[And the Guardian will come] and the elders with him until... and they

Four Classes of the Community
(4Q279)
Formerly known as 4QTohorot Da, this fragment is one of three small
scraps which have partly preserved the division of the Community into
four lots or classes, already known from CD XIV, 5-6, viz. Priests,
Levites, Israelites and Proselytes.
For the editio princeps, see P. S. Alexander and G. Vermes, DJD,

according to his spirit. And] the fourth lot will belong to the Prosely[tes]

The Damascus Document
(CD, 4Q265-73, 5Q12, 6Q15)
Extensive fragments of the Damascus Document have been
recovered from three of the Qumran caves (4Q265-73, 5Q12=CD IX,
7-10, 6Q15=CD IV, 19-21, V, 13-14, v, I-VI, 2, VI, 20-VII, I plus a text
unparalleled in CD), but two incomplete medieval copies of this
document had been found already many years earlier, in 1896-7,
amongst a mass of discarded manuscripts in a storeroom (genizah) of
an old Cairo synagogue. Published in 1910 by S. Schechter
(Fragments of a Zadokite Work, Cambridge), they were reprinted with
a new Prolegomenon by J. A. Fitzmyer in 1970, re-edited by Chaim
Rabin under the title The Zadokite Documents (Oxford, 1954) and in
the light of the 4Q fragments by M. Broshi, The Damascus Document
Reconsidered, Jerusalem, 1992. Cf. also J. M. Baumgarten et al. in J.
H. Charlesworth et al., eds., The DSS II:Damascus Document...,
1995, 4-79. For the editio princeps, see J. M. Baumgarten, DJD, XVIII,
1996.
Dating from the tenth and twelfth centuries respectively, the
manuscripts found in Cairo - Manuscript A and Manuscript B - raise a
certain number of textual problems in that they present two different
versions of the original composition. I have settled the difficulty as
satisfactorily as I can by following Manuscript A, to which the 4Q
fragments correspond, and by inserting the Manuscript B variants in
brackets or footnotes. At a certain point, as the reader will see,
Manuscript A comes to an end and we then have to rely entirely on
Manuscript B. Furthermore, two of the Cave 4 manuscripts (4Q266
and 268) show that page 1 of the Cairo document was preceded by
another section of which both the beginning and the end have survived.
Also 4Q266 and 270 indicate that in antiquity the text corresponding to
CD IX, 1 was preceded by CD XVI. In the translation I have therefore


---

## Page 162

rearranged the order of the pages and placed pages xv and XVI
before page ix.
The title ‘Damascus Document’ derives from the references in the
Exhortation to the ‘New Covenant’ made ‘in the land of Damascus’.
The significance of this phrase is discussed in Chapter III together with
the chronological data included in the manuscript. They suggest that
the document was written in about 100 BCE and this hypothesis is
indirectly supported by the absence of any mention in the historical
passages of the Kittim (Romans) whose invasion of the Orient did not
take place until after 70 BCE.
The work is divided into an Exhortation and a list of Statutes. In the
Exhortation, the preacher - probably a Guardian of the Community -
addresses his ‘sons’ on the themes of the sect’s teaching, many of
which appear also in the Community Rule. His aim is to encourage the
sectaries to remain faithful, and with this end in view he sets out to
demonstrate from the history of Israel and the Community that fidelity is
always rewarded and apostasy chastised.
During the course of his argument, the author of the Damascus
Document frequently interprets biblical passages in a most
unexpected way. I have mentioned one of these commentaries on the
marriage laws in Chapter IV (pp. 69-70), but there is another intricate
exposition of Amos v, 26-7 on p. 135 which may not be easy to
understand.
In the Bible these verses convey a divine threat: the Israelites were
to take themselves and their idols into exile: ‘You shall take up Sakkuth
your king and Kaiwan your star-god, your images which you made for
yourselves, for I will take you into exile beyond Damascus.’ But the
Damascus Document transforms this threat into a promise of
salvation; by changing certain words in the biblical text and omitting
others its version reads: ‘I will exile the tabernacle of your king and the
bases of your statues from my tent to Damascus.’
In this new text, the three key phrases are interpreted symbolically as
follows: ‘tabernacle’ = ‘Books of the Law’; ‘king’ = ‘congregation’;
‘bases of statues’ = ‘Books of the Prophets’. Thus: ‘The Books of the
Law are the tabernacle of the king; as God said, I will raise up the
tabernacle of David which is fallen (Amos ix, 11). The king is the


---

## Page 163

congregation; and the bases of the statues are the Books of the
Prophets whose sayings Israel despised.’
The omission of any reference to the ‘star-god’ is made good by
introducing a very different ‘Star’, the messianic ‘Interpreter of the Law’
with his companion the ‘Prince of the congregation’. ‘The star is the
Interpreter of the Law who shall come to Damascus; as it is written, A
star shall come forth out of Jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of
Israel (Num. xxiv, 17). The sceptre is the Prince of the whole
congregation...’
The second part of the Damascus Document, the Statutes, consists
of a collection of laws which mostly reflect a sectarian reinterpretation
of the biblical commandments relative to vows and oaths, tribunals,
purification, the Sabbath and the distinction between ritual purity and
impurity. They are followed by rules concerned with the institutions and
organization of the Community. Some of the particular laws of the
Damascus Rule appear also in the Temple Scroll (cf. p. 192).
Whereas the Exhortation represents a literary genre adopted by
both Jewish and Christian religious teachers (e.g. the Letter to the
Hebrews), the methodical grouping of the Statutes prefigures that of
the Mishnah, the oldest extant Jewish code.
The Statutes as they appear in the Qumran fragments include the
form of the ritual for the Feast of the Renewal of the Covenant, so it
may be assumed that the entire Damascus Document was originally
connected with that festival. 4Q266, as will be seen presently,
specifies that it occurred in the third month, i.e. that it coincided with
the Feast of Weeks, celebrated on the fifteenth day of the third month
according to the sect’s calendar.
The translation of those Cave 4 fragments which are additional to
CD will follow the presentation of the Cairo manuscripts.
The Exhortation
I Listen now74 all you who know righteousness, and consider the works
of God; for He has a dispute with all flesh and will condemn all those


---

## Page 164

who despise Him.
For when they were unfaithful and forsook Him, He hid His face from
Israel and His Sanctuary and delivered them up to the sword. But
remembering the Covenant of the forefathers, He left a remnant to
Israel and did not deliver it up to be destroyed. And in the age of wrath,
three hundred and ninety years after He had given them into the hand
of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, He visited them, and He caused
a plant root to spring from Israel and Aaron to inherit His Land and to
prosper on the good things of His earth. And they perceived their
iniquity and recognized that they were guilty men, yet for twenty years
they were like blind men groping for the way.
And God observed their deeds, that they sought Him with a whole
heart, and He raised for them a Teacher of Righteousness to guide
them in the way of His heart. And he made known to the latter
generations that which God had done to the latter generation, the
congregation of traitors, to those who departed from the way. This was
the time of which it is written, Like a stubborn heifer thus was Israel
stubborn (Hos. iv. 16), when the Scoffer arose who shed over Israel
the waters of lies. He caused them to wander in a pathless wilderness,
laying low the everlasting heights, abolishing the ways of
righteousness and removing the boundary with which the forefathers
had marked out their inheritance, that he might call down on them the
curses of His Covenant and deliver them up to the avenging sword of
the Covenant. For they sought smooth things and preferred illusions
(Isa. xxx, 10) and they watched for breaks (Isa. xxx, 13) and chose the
fair neck; and they justified the wicked and condemned the just, and
they transgressed the Covenant and violated the Precept. They
banded together against the life of the righteous (Ps. xciv, 21) and
loathed all who walked in perfection; they pursued them with the sword
and exulted in the strife of the people. And the anger of God was
kindled against II their congregation so that He ravaged all their
multitude; and their deeds were defilement before Him.
Hear now, all you who enter the Covenant, and I will unstop your ears
concerning the ways of the wicked.75
God loves knowledge. Wisdom and understanding He has set
before Him, and prudence and knowledge serve Him. Patience and


---

## Page 165

much forgiveness are with Him towards those who turn from
transgression; but power, might, and great flaming wrath by the hand of
all the Angels of Destruction towards those who depart from the way
and abhor the Precept. They shall have no remnant or survivor. For
from the beginning God chose them not; He knew their deeds before
ever they were created and He hated their generations, and He hid His
face from the Land until they were consumed. For He knew the years
of their coming and the length and exact duration of their times for all
ages to come and throughout eternity. He knew the happenings of their
times throughout all the everlasting years. And in all of them He raised
for Himself men called by name76 that a remnant might be left to the
Land, and that the face of the earth might be filled with their seed. And
He made known His Holy Spirit to them by the hand of His anointed
ones, and He proclaimed the truth (to them). But those whom He hated
He led astray.
Hear now, my sons, and I will uncover your eyes that you may see
and understand the works of God, that you may choose that which
pleases Him and reject that which He hates, that you may walk
perfectly in all His ways and not follow after thoughts of the guilty
inclination and after eyes of lust. For through them, great men have
gone astray and mighty heroes have stumbled from former times till
now. Because they walked in the stubbornness of their heart the
Heavenly Watchers fell; they were caught because they did not keep
the commandments of God. And their sons also fell who were tall as
cedar trees and whose bodies were like mountains. All flesh on dry
land perished; they were as though they had never been because they
did their own will and did not keep the commandment of their Maker so
that His wrath was kindled against them. III Through it, the children of
Noah went astray, together with their kin, and were cut off. Abraham
did not walk in it, and he was accounted a friend of God because he
kept the commandments of God and did not choose his own will. And
he handed them down to Isaac and Jacob, who kept them, and were
recorded as friends of God and party to the Covenant for ever. The
children of Jacob strayed through them and were punished in
accordance with their error. And their sons in Egypt walked in the
stubbornness of their hearts, conspiring against the commandments of


---

## Page 166

God and each of them doing that which seemed right in his own eyes.
They ate blood, and He cut off their males in the wilderness. And at
Kadesh He said to them, Go up and possess the land (Deut. ix, 23).
But they chose their own will and did not heed the voice of their Maker,
the commands of their Teacher, but murmured in their tents; and the
anger of God was kindled against their congregation. Through it their
sons perished, and through it their kings were cut off; through it their
mighty heroes perished and through it their land was ravaged. Through
it the first members of the Covenant sinned and were delivered up to
the sword, because they forsook the Covenant of God and chose their
own will and walked in the stubbornness of their hearts, each of them
doing his own will.
But with the remnant which held fast to the commandments of God
He made His Covenant with Israel for ever, revealing to them the
hidden things in which all Israel had gone astray. He unfolded before
them His holy Sabbaths and his glorious feasts, the testimonies of His
righteousness and the ways of His truth, and the desires of His will
which a man must do in order to live. And they dug a well rich in water;
and he who despises it shall not live. Yet they wallowed in the sin of
man and in ways of uncleanness, and they said, ‘This is our (way).’ But
God, in His wonderful mysteries, forgave them their sin and pardoned
their wickedness; and He built them a sure house in Israel whose like
has never existed from former times till now. Those who hold fast to it
are destined to live for ever and all the glory of Adam shall be theirs.
As God ordained for them by the hand of the Prophet Ezekiel, saying,
The Priests, the Levites, and the sons IV of Zadok who kept the
charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel strayed from me,
they shall offer me fat and blood (Ezek. xliv, 15).
The Priests are the converts of Israel who departed from the land of
Judah, and (the Levites are) those who joined them. The sons of
Zadok are the elect of Israel, the men called by name who shall stand
at the end of days. Behold the exact list of their names according to
their generations, and the time when they lived, and the number of their
trials, and the years of their sojourn, and the exact list of their deeds...
(They were the first men) of holiness whom God forgave, and who
justified the righteous and condemned the wicked. And until the age is


---

## Page 167

completed, according to the number of those years, all who enter after
them shall do according to that interpretation of the Law in which the
first (men) were instructed. According to the Covenant which God
made with the forefathers, forgiving their sins, so shall He forgive their
sins also. But when the age is completed, according to the number of
those years, there shall be no more joining the house of Judah, but
each man shall stand on his watch-tower: The wall is built, the
boundary far removed (Mic. vii, II).
During all those years Belial shall be unleashed against Israel, as He
spoke by the hand of Isaiah, son of Amoz, saying, Terror and the pit
and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the land (Isa. xxiv, 17).
Interpreted, these are the three nets of Belial with which Levi son of
Jacob said that he catches Israel by setting them up as three kinds of
righteousness. The first is fornication, the second is riches, and the
third is profanation of the Temple. Whoever escapes the first is caught
in the second, and whoever saves himself from the second is caught in
the third (Isa. xxiv, 18).
The ‘builders of the wall’ (Ezek. xiii, 10) who have followed after
‘Precept’ - ‘Precept’ was a spouter of whom it is written, They shall
surely spout (Mic. ii, 6) - shall be caught in fornication twice by taking a
second wife while the first is alive, whereas the principle of creation is,
Male and female created He them (Gen. i, 27)’ V Also, those who
entered the Ark went in two by two. And concerning the prince it is
written, He shall not multiply wives to himself (Deut. xvii, 17); but
David had not read the sealed book of the Law which was in the ark
(of the Covenant), for it was not opened in Israel from the death of
Eleazar and Joshua, and the elders who worshipped Ashtoreth. It was
hidden and (was not) revealed until the coming of Zadok. And the
deeds of David rose up, except for the murder of Uriah, and God left
them to him.
Moreover, they profane the Temple because they do not observe the
distinction (between clean and unclean) in accordance with the Law,
but lie with a woman who sees her bloody discharge.
And each man marries the daughter of his brother or sister, whereas
Moses said, You shall not approach your mother’s sister; she is your
mothers near kin (Lev. xviii, 13). But although the laws against incest


---

## Page 168

are written for men, they also apply to women. When, therefore, a
brother’s daughter uncovers the nakedness of her father’s brother, she
is (also his) near kin.
Furthermore, they defile their holy spirit and open their mouth with a
blaspheming tongue against the laws of the Covenant of God saying,
‘They are not sure.’ They speak abominations concerning them; they
are all kindlers of fire and lighters of brands (Isa. 1, 11), their webs
are spiders’ webs and their eggs are vipers’ eggs (Isa. lix, 5). No man
that approaches them shall be free from guilt; the more he does so, the
guiltier shall he be, unless he is pressed. For (already) in ancient times
God visited their deeds and His anger was kindled against their
works; for it is a people of no discernment (Isa. xxvii, II), it is a nation
void of counsel inasmuch as there is no discernment in them (Deut.
xxxii, 28). For in ancient times, Moses and Aaron arose by the hand of
the Prince of Lights and Belial in his cunning raised up Jannes and his
brother when Israel was first delivered.77
And at the time of the desolation of the land there arose removers of
the bound who led Israel astray. And the land was ravaged because
they preached rebellion against the commandments of God given by
the hand of Moses and VI of His holy anointed ones, and because they
prophesied lies to turn Israel away from following God. But God
remembered the Covenant with the forefathers, and he raised from
Aaron men of discernment and from Israel men of wisdom, and He
caused them to hear. And they dug the Well:78 the well which the
princes dug, which the nobles of the people delved with the stave
(Num. xxi, 18).
The Well is the Law, and those who dug it were the converts of Israel
who went out of the land of Judah to sojourn in the land of Damascus.
God called them all princes because they sought Him, and their
renown was disputed by no man. The Stave is the Interpreter of the
Law of whom Isaiah said, He makes a tool for His work (Isa. liv, 16);
and the nobles of the people are those who come to dig the Well with
the staves with which the Stave ordained that they should walk in all the
age of wickedness - and without them they shall find nothing - until he
comes who shall teach righteousness at the end of days.
None of those brought into the Covenant shall enter the Temple to


---

## Page 169

light His altar in vain. They shall bar the door, forasmuch as God said,
Who among you will bar its door? And, You shall not light my altar in
vain (Mal. i, 10). They shall take care to act according to the exact
interpretation of the Law during the age of wickedness. They shall
separate from the sons of the Pit, and shall keep away from the
unclean riches of wickedness acquired by vow or anathema or from
the Temple treasure; they shall not rob the poor of His people, to make
of widows their prey and of the fatherless their victim (Isa. x, 2). They
shall distinguish between clean and unclean, and shall proclaim the
difference between holy and profane. They shall keep the Sabbath day
according to its exact interpretation, and the feasts and the Day of
Fasting according to the finding of the members of the New Covenant
in the land of Damascus. They shall set aside the holy things according
to the exact teaching concerning them. They shall love each man his
brother as himself; they shall succour the poor, the needy, and the
stranger.
A man shall seek his brother’s well-being VII and shall not sin
against his near kin. They shall keep from fornication according to the
statute. They shall rebuke each man his brother according to the
commandment and shall bear no rancour from one day to the next.
They shall keep apart from every uncleanness according to the
statutes relating to each one, and no man shall defile his holy spirit
since God has set them apart. For all who walk in these (precepts) in
perfect holiness, according to all the teaching of God, the Covenant of
God shall be an assurance that they shall live for thousands of
generations (MS. B: as it is written, Keeping the Covenant and grace
with those who love me and keep my commandments, to a thousand
generations, Deut. vii, 9).
And if they live in camps according to the rule of the Land (MS. B: as
it was from ancient times), marrying (MS. B: according to the custom
of the Law) and begetting children, they shall walk according to the
Law and according to the statute concerning binding vows, according
to the rule of the Law which says, Between a man and his wife and
between a father and his son (Num. xxx, 17). And all those who
despise (MS. B: the commandments and the statutes) shall be
rewarded with the retribution of the wicked when God shall visit the

Land, when the saying shall come to pass which is written79 among the
words of the Prophet Isaiah son of Amoz: He will bring upon you, and
upon your people, and upon your father’s house, days such as have
not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah (Isa. vii,
17). When the two houses of Israel were divided, Ephraim departed
from Judah. And all the apostates were given up to the sword, but
those who held fast escaped to the land of the north; as God said, I will
exile the tabernacle of your king and the bases of your statues from
my tent to Damascus (Amos v, 26-7)
The Books of the Law are the tabernacle of the king; as God said, I
will raise up the tabernacle of David which is fallen (Amos ix, II). The
king is the congregation; and the bases of the statues are the Books
of the Prophets whose sayings Israel despised. The star is the
Interpreter of the Law who shall come to Damascus; as it is written, A
star shall come forth out ofJacob and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel
(Num. xxiv, 17). The sceptre is the Prince of the whole congregation,
and when he comes he shall smite all the children of Seth (Num. xxiv,
17).
At the time of the former Visitation they were saved, whereas the
apostates VIII were given up to the sword; and so shall it be for all the
members of His Covenant who do not hold steadfastly to these (MS. B:
to the curse of the precepts). They shall be visited for destruction by
the hand of Belial. That shall be the day when God will visit. (MS. B: As
He said,) The princes of Judah have become (MS. B: like those who
remove the bound); wrath shall be poured upon them (Hos. v, 10).
For they shall hope for healing but He will crush them. They are all of
them rebels, for they80 have not turned from the way of traitors but have
wallowed in the ways of whoredom and wicked wealth. They have
taken revenge and borne malice, every man against his brother, and
every man has hated his fellow, and every man has sinned against his
near kin, and has approached for unchastity, and has acted arrogantly
for the sake of riches and gain. And every man has done that which
seemed right in his eyes and has chosen the stubbornness of his
heart. They have not kept apart from the people (MS. B: and their sin)
and have wilfully rebelled by walking in the ways of the wicked of whom
God said, Their wine is the venom of serpents, the cruel poison (or

head) of asps (Deut. xxxii, 33).
The serpents are the kings of the peoples and their wine is their
ways. And the head of asps is the chief of the kings of Greece who
came to wreak vengeance upon them. But all these things the builders
of the wall and those who daub it with plaster (Ezek. xiii, 10) have not
understood because a follower of the wind, one who raised storms and
rained down lies, had preached to them (Mic. ii, 11), against all of
whose assembly the anger of God was kindled.
And as for that which Moses said, You enter to possess these
nations not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your
hearts (Deut. ix, 5) but because God loved your fathers and kept the
oath (Deut. vii, 8), thus shall it be with the converts of Israel who depart
from the way of the people. Because God loved the first (men) who81
testified in His favour, so will He love those who come after them, for
the Covenant of the fathers is theirs. But He hated the builders of the
wall and His anger was kindled (MS. B: against them and against all
those who followed them); and so shall it be for all who reject the
commandments of God and abandon them for the stubbornness of
their hearts. This is the word which Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of
Neriah, and which Elisha spoke to his servant Gehazi.
None of the men who enter the New Covenant in the land of
Damascus, (B I) and who again betray it and depart from the fountain
of living waters, shall be reckoned with the Council of the people or
inscribed in its Book from the day of the gathering in (B II) of the
Teacher of the Community until the coming of the Messiah out of Aaron
and Israel.
And thus shall it be for every man who enters the congregation of
men of perfect holiness but faints in performing the duties of the
upright. He is a man who has melted in the furnace (Ezek. xxii, 22);
when his deeds are revealed he shall be expelled from the
congregation as though his lot had never fallen among the disciples of
God. The men of knowledge shall rebuke him in accordance with his
sin against the time when he shall stand again before the Assembly of
the men of perfect holiness. But when his deeds are revealed,
according to the interpretation of the Law in which the men of perfect
holiness walk, let no man defer to him with regard to money or work,


---

## Page 172

for all the Holy Ones of the Most High have cursed him.
And thus shall it be for all among the first and the last who reject (the
precepts), who set idols upon their hearts and walk in the
stubbornness of their hearts; they shall have no share in the house of
the Law. They shall be judged in the same manner as their
companions were judged who deserted to the Scoffer. For they have
spoken wrongly against the precepts of righteousness, and have
despised the Covenant and the Pact - the New Covenant - which they
made in the land of Damascus. Neither they nor their kin shall have any
part in the house of the Law.
From the day of the gathering in of the Teacher of the Community
until the end of all the men of war who deserted to the Liar there shall
pass about forty years (Deut. ii, 14). And during that age the wrath of
God shall be kindled against Israel; as He said, There shall be no
king, no prince, no judge, no man to rebuke with justice (Hos. iii, 4).
But those who turn from the sin of Jacob, who keep the Covenant of
God, shall then speak each man to his fellow, to justify each man his
brother, that their step may take the way of God. And God will heed
their words and will hear, and a Book of Reminder shall be written
before Him of them that fear God and worship His Name, against the
time when salvation and righteousness shall be revealed to them that
fear God. And then shall you distinguish once more between the just
and the wicked, between one that serves God and one that serves
Him not (Mal. iii, 18); and He will show loving-kindness to thousands,
to them that love Him and watch for Him, for a thousand generations
(Exod. xx, 6).
And every member of the House of Separation who went out of the
Holy City and leaned on God at the time when Israel sinned and defiled
the Temple, but returned again to the way of the people in small
matters, shall be judged according to his spirit in the Council of
Holiness. But when the glory of God is made manifest to Israel, all
those members of the Covenant who have breached the bound of the
Law shall be cut off from the midst of the camp, and with them all those
who condemned Judah in the days of its trials.
But all those who hold fast to these precepts, going and coming in
accordance with the Law, who heed the voice of the Teacher and


---

## Page 173

confess before God, (saying), ‘Truly we have sinned, we and our
fathers, by walking counter to the precepts of the Covenant, Thy
judgements upon us are justice and truth’; who do not lift their hand
against His holy precepts or His righteous statutes or His true
testimonies; who have learned from the former judgements by which
the members of the Community were judged; who have listened to the
voice of the Teacher of Righteousness and have not despised the
precepts of righteousness when they heard them; they shall rejoice and
their hearts shall be strong, and they shall prevail over all the sons of
the earth. God will forgive them and they shall see His salvation
because they took refuge in His holy Name.82
The Statutes
... (He shall not) XV swear by (the Name), nor by Aleph and Lamed
(Elohim), nor by Aleph and Daleth (Adonai), but a binding oath by the
curses of the Covenant.
He shall not mention the Law of Moses for... were he to swear and
then break (his oath) he would profane the Name.
But if he has sworn an oath by the curses of the Covenant before the
judges and has transgressed it, then he is guilty and shall confess and
make restitution; but he shall not be burdened with a capital sin.
And all those who have entered the Covenant, granted to all Israel
for ever, shall make their children who have reached the age of
enrolment, swear with the oath of the Covenant. And thus shall it be
during all the age of wickedness for every man who repents of his
corrupted way. On the day that he speaks to the Guardian of the
congregation, they shall enrol him with the oath of the Covenant which
Moses made with Israel, the Covenant to return to the Law of Moses
with a whole heart and soul, to whatever is found should be done at
that time. No man shall make known the statutes to him until he has
stood before the Guardian, lest when examining him the Guardian be
deceived by him. But if he transgresses after swearing to return to the
Law of Moses with a whole heart and soul, they (the members) shall be


---

## Page 174

innocent should he transgress. And should he err in any matter that is
revealed of the Law to the multitude of the camp, the Guardian shall
{instruct} (4Q266, fr. 8 i, 5) him and shall issue directions concerning
him: he should stu[dy] for a full year.83 And according to his (the
Guardian’s) knowledge, {no madman, or lunatic shall enter, no
simpleton, or fool, no blind man, or maimed, or lame, or deaf man, and
no minor, none of these shall enter into the Community, for the Angels
of Holiness are [in their midst]} (4Q266, fr. 8 i, 6-9).
(For God made) XVI a Covenant with you and all Israel; therefore a
man shall bind himself by oath to return to the Law of Moses, for in it all
things are strictly defined.
As for the exact determination of their times to which Israel turns a
blind eye, behold it is strictly defined in the Book of the Divisions of
the Times into their Jubilees and Weeks. And on the day that a man
swears to return to the Law of Moses, the Angel of Persecution shall
cease to follow him provided that he fulfils his word: for this reason
Abraham circumcised himself on the day that he knew.
And concerning the saying, You shall keep your vow by fulfilling it
(Deut. xxiii, 24), let no man, even at the price of death, annul any
binding oath by which he has sworn to keep a commandment of the
Law.
But even at the price of death, a man shall fulfil no vow by which he
has sworn to depart from the Law.
Concerning the oath of a woman
Inasmuch as He said, It is for her husband to cancel her oath (Num.
xxx, 9), no husband shall cancel an oath without knowing whether it
should be kept or not. Should it be such as to lead to transgression of
the Covenant, he shall cancel it and shall not let it be kept. The rule for
her father is likewise.
Concerning the statute for free-will offerings


---

## Page 175

No man shall vow to the altar anything unlawfully acquired. Also, no
Priest shall take from Israel anything unlawfully acquired. And no man
shall consecrate the food of his house to God, for it is as he said, Each
hunts his brother with a net (or votive-offering: Mic. vii, 2). Let no man
consecrate... And if he has consecrated to God some of his own field
... he who has made the vow shall be punished ... {[with] one sixth of his
valuation money} (4Q266, fr. 8 ii, 2-3) ...
IX84 Every vow by which a man vows another to destruction (cf. Lev.
xxvii, 29) by the laws of the Gentiles shall himself be put to death. And
concerning the saying, You shall not take vengeance on the children
of your people, nor bear any rancour against them (Lev. xix, 18), if
any member of the Covenant accuses his companion without first
rebuking him before85 witnesses; if he denounces him in the heat of
his anger or reports him to his elders to make him look contemptible,
he is one that takes vengeance and bears rancour, although it is
expressly written, He takes vengeance upon His adversaries and
bears rancour against His enemies (Nah. i, 2). If he holds his peace
towards him from one day to another86 and thereafter speaks of him in
the heat of his anger, he testifies against himself concerning a capital
matter because he has not fulfilled the commandment of God which
tells him: You shall rebuke your companion and not be burdened with
sin because of him (Lev. xix, 17).
Concerning the oath with reference to that which He said, You
shall not take the law into your own hands (I Sam. XXV, 26)
Whoever causes another to swear in the field instead of before the
Judges, or at their decree, takes the law into his own hands. When
anything is lost, and it is not known who has stolen it from the property
of the camp in which it was stolen, its owner shall pronounce a curse,
and any man who, on hearing (it), knows but does not tell, shall himself
be guilty.
When anything is returned which is without an owner, whoever


---

## Page 176

returns it shall confess to the Priest, and apart from the ram of the sin-
offering, it shall be his.
And likewise, everything which is found but has no owner shall go to
the Priests, for the finder is ignorant of the rule concerning it. If no
owners are discovered they shall keep it.
Every sin which a man commits against the Law, and which his
companion witnesses, he being alone, if it is a capital matter he shall
report it to the Guardian, rebuking him in his presence, and the
Guardian shall record it against him in case he should commit it again
before one man and he should report it to the Guardian once more.
Should he repeat it and be caught in the act before one man, his case
shall be complete.
And if there are two (witnesses), each testifying to a different matter,
the man shall be excluded from the pure Meal provided that they are
trustworthy and that each informs the Guardian on the day that they
witnessed (the offence). In matters of property, they shall accept two
trustworthy witnesses and shall exclude (the culprit) from the pure Meal
on the word of one witness alone. No X Judge shall pass sentence of
death on the testimony of a witness who has not yet attained the age of
enrolment and who is not God-fearing.
No man who has wilfully transgressed any commandment shall be
declared a trustworthy witness against his companion until he is
purified and able to return.
And this is the Rule for the Judges of the Congregation
Ten shall be elected from the congregation for a definite time, four
from the tribe of Levi and Aaron, and six from Israel. (They shall be)
learned in the Book of Meditation and in the constitutions of the
Covenant, and aged between twenty-five and sixty years. No man over
the age of sixty shall hold office as Judge of the Congregation, for
‘because man sinned his days have been shortened, and in the heat of
His anger against the inhabitants of the earth God ordained that their
understanding should depart even before their days are completed’
(Jubilees, xxiii, II).

Concerning purification by water
No man shall bathe in dirty water or in an amount too shallow to
cover a man. He shall not purify himself with water contained in a87
vessel. And as for the water of every rock-pool too shallow to cover a
man, if an unclean man touches it he renders its water as unclean as
water contained in a vessel.
Concerning the Sabbath to observe it according to its law
No man shall work on the sixth day from the moment when the sun’s
orb is distant by its own fulness from the gate (wherein it sinks); for this
is what He said, Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy (Deut. v,
12). No man shall speak any vain or idle word on the Sabbath day. He
shall make no loan to his companion. He shall make no decision in
matters of money and gain. He shall say nothing about work or labour
to be done on the morrow.
No man shall walk in the field88 to do business on the Sabbath. He
shall not walk more than one thousand cubits beyond his town.
No man shall eat on the Sabbath day except that which is already
prepared. He shall eat nothing lying in the fields. He shall not drink
except in the camp. XI If he is on a journey and goes down to bathe, he
shall drink where he stands, but he shall not draw water into a vessel.
He shall send out no stranger on his business on the Sabbath day. No
man shall wear soiled garments, or garments brought to the store,
unless they have been washed with water or rubbed with incense. No
man shall willingly mingle (with others) on the Sabbath.
No man shall walk more than two thousand cubits after a beast to
pasture it outside his town. He shall not raise his hand to strike it with
his fist. If it is stubborn he shall not take it out of his house.
No man shall take anything out of the house or bring anything in. And
if he is in a booth, let him neither take anything out nor bring anything
in. He shall not open a sealed vessel on the Sabbath.


---

## Page 178

No man shall carry perfumes on himself whilst going and coming on
the Sabbath. He shall lift neither stone nor dust in his dwelling.
No man minding a child shall carry it whilst going and coming on the
Sabbath.
No man shall chide89 his manservant or maidservant or labourer on
the Sabbath.90 No man shall assist a beast to give birth on the
Sabbath day. And if it should fall into a cistern or pit, he shall not lift it
out on the Sabbath.
No man shall spend the Sabbath in a place near to Gentiles on the
Sabbath.
No man shall profane the Sabbath for the sake of riches or gain on
the Sabbath day. But should any man fall into water or (fire), let him not
be pulled out with the aid of a ladder or rope or (some such) utensil.
No man on the Sabbath shall offer anything on the altar except the
Sabbath burnt-offering; for it is written thus: Except your Sabbath
offerings (Lev. xxiii, 38).
No man shall send to the altar any burnt-offering, or cereal offering,
or incense, or wood, by the hand of one smitten with any uncleanness,
permitting him thus to defile the altar. For it is written, The sacrifice of
the wicked is an abomination, but the prayer of the just is as an
agreeable offering (Prov. xv, 8).
No man entering the house of worship shall come unclean and in
need of washing. And at the sounding of the trumpets for assembly, he
shall go there before or after (the meeting), and shall not cause the
whole service to stop, XII for it is a holy service.
No man shall lie with a woman in the city of the Sanctuary, to defile
the city of the Sanctuary with their uncleanness.
Every man who preaches apostasy under the dominion of the spirits
of Belial shall be judged according to the law relating to those
possessed by a ghost or familiar spirit (Lev. xx, 27). But no man who
strays so as to profane the Sabbath and the feasts shall be put to
death; it shall fall to men to keep him in custody. And if he is healed of
his error, they shall keep him in custody for seven years and he shall
afterwards approach the Assembly.
No man shall stretch out his hand to shed the blood of a Gentile for
the sake of riches and gain. Nor shall he carry off anything of theirs,


---

## Page 179

lest they blaspheme, unless so advised by the company of Israel.
No man shall sell clean beasts or birds to the Gentiles lest they offer
them in sacrifice. He shall refuse, with all his power, to sell them
anything from his granary or wine-press, and he shall not sell them his
manservant or maidservant inasmuch as they have been brought by
him into the Covenant of Abraham.
No man shall defile himself by eating any live creature or creeping
thing, from the larvae of bees to all creatures which creep in water.
They shall eat no fish unless split alive and their blood poured out. And
as for locusts, according to their various kinds they shall plunge them
alive into fire or water, for this is what their nature requires.
All wood and stones and dust defiled by the impurity of a man shall
be reckoned like men having defilement of oil on them; whoever
touches them shall be defiled by their defilement. And every nail or peg
in the wall of a house in which a dead man lies shall become unclean
as any working tool becomes unclean (Lev. xi, 32).
The Rule for the assembly of the towns of Israel shall be according to
these precepts that they may distinguish between unclean and clean,
and discriminate between the holy and the profane.
And these are the precepts in which the Master shall walk in his
commerce with all the living in accordance with the statute proper to
every age. And in accordance with this statute shall the seed of Israel
walk and they shall not be cursed.
This is the Rule for the assembly of the camps
Those who follow these statutes in the age of wickedness until the
coming of the Messiah of Aaron XIII and Israel shall form groups of at
least ten men, by Thousands, Hundreds, Fifties, and Tens (Exod.
xviii, 25)-And where the ten are, there shall never be lacking a Priest
learned in the Book of Meditation; they shall all be ruled by him.
But should he not be experienced in these matters, whereas one of
the Levites is experienced in them, then it shall be determined that all
the members of the camp shall go and come according to the latter’s
word.

## Page 180

But should there be a case of applying the law of leprosy to a man,
then the Priest shall come and shall stand in the camp and the
Guardian shall instruct him in the exact interpretation of the Law.
Even if the Priest is a simpleton, it is he who shall lock up (the leper);
for theirs is the judgement.
This is the Rule for the Guardian of the camp
He shall instruct the Congregation in the works of God. He shall
cause them to consider His mighty deeds and shall recount all the
happenings of eternity to them [according to] their [ex]planation
(4Q267, fr. 9 iv, 2). He shall love them as a father loves his children,
and shall carry them in all their distress like a shepherd his sheep. He
shall loosen all the fetters which bind them that in his Congregation
there may be none that are oppressed or broken. He shall examine
every man entering his Congregation with regard to his deeds,
understanding, strength, ability and possessions, and shall inscribe
him in his place according to his rank in the lot of L[ight].
No member of the camp shall have authority to admit a man to the
Congregation against the decision of the Guardian of the camp.
No member of the Covenant of God shall give or receive anything
from the sons of Dawn (shahar) [or: of the Pit (shahat)] except for
payment.
No man shall form any association for buying and selling without
informing the Guardian of the camp and shall act on (his) advice and
they shall not go {astray. Likewise he who marri[es]} (4Q266, fr. 9 ii, 4)
a woma[n] ... advice. Likewise he who divorces (his wife). And he (the
Guardian) shall instruct {their sons [and their daughters in a spiri]t}
(4Q266, fr. 9 ii, 6-7) of humility and in loving-kindness and shall not
keep {anger} (4Q266, fr. 9 ii, 8) towards them ...
This is the Rule for the assembly of the camps during all [the age of
wickedness, and whoever does not hold fast to] these (statutes) shall
not be fit to dwell in the Land [when the Messiah of Aaron and Israel
shall come at the end of days].
[And] these are the [precepts] in which the Master [shall walk in his


---

## Page 181

commerce with all the living until God shall visit the earth. As He said,
There shall come upon you, and upon your people, and upon your
father’s house, days] XIV such as have not come since Ephraim
departed from Judah (Isa. vii, 17); but for whoever shall walk in these
(precepts), the Covenant of God shall stand firm to save him from all
the snares of the Pit, whereas the foolish shall be punished.91
The Rule for the assembly of all the camps
They shall all be enrolled by name: first the Priests, second the
Levites, third the Israelites, and fourth the proselytes. And they shall be
inscribed by name, one after the other: the Priests first, the Levites
second, the Israelites third, and the proselytes fourth. And thus shall
they sit and thus be questioned on all matters. And the Priest who is
appointed {to head} (4Q267, fr. 9 v, II) the Congregation shall be from
thirty to sixty years old, learned in the Book of Meditation and in all the
judgements of the Law so as to pronounce them correctly.
The Guardian of all the camps shall be from thirty to fifty years old,
one who has mastered all the secrets of men and the languages of all
their clans. Whoever enters the Congregation shall do so according to
his word, each in his rank. And whoever has anything to say92 with
regard to any suit or judgement, let him say it to the Guardian.
This is the Rule for the Congregation by which it shall provide
for all its needs
They shall place the earnings of at least two days out of every month
into the hands of the Guardian and the Judges, and from it they shall
give to the fatherless, and from it they shall succour the poor and the
needy, the aged sick and the man who is stricken (with disease), the
captive taken by a foreign people, the virgin with no near kin, and the
ma[id for] whom no man cares ...
And this is the exact statement of the assembly ...

This is the exact statement of the statutes in which [they shall
walk until the coming of the Messia]hof Aaron and Israel who
will pardon their iniquity

penance for six days ...
[Whoever slanders his companion or bears rancour] unjustly [shall
do penance for one] year...

Damascus Document manuscripts from Cave 4
Three Qumran caves have provided supplementary documentation to
the text preserved in the Cairo Genizah. Of these the evidence
furnished by Caves 5 (CD IX, 7-10) and 6 (CD IV, 19-21, v, 13-14, v,
18-VI, 2, VI, 20-VII, 1) is negligible, but the fragments discovered in
Cave 4 (4Q266-273) are of the highest importance. Furthermore
4Q265 provides a kind of hybrid connecting the Damascus Document
and the Community Rule. Palaeographically 4Q266-73 are dated from
the mid-first century BCE to the beginning of the first century CE.
The 4Q material represents (1) a prologue missing from CD
(4Q266, fr. I—b; fr. 2 i, 1-6, combined with 4Q267, fr. 1 and 268, fr. 1)
and substantial legal sections which follow the broken ending of the
Statutes of CD. These laws relate to (2) the admission or dismissal of
candidates (4Q266, fr. 5); to (3) criteria for disqualifying priests
(4Q266, fr. 5; 267, fr. 5 ii; 273, frs. 2, 4 i); to (4) detailed rulings
concerning the diagnosis and quarantining of persons suffering from
skin disease (4Q266, fr. 6; 272, fr. 1); to (5) laws pertaining to
gleanings (4Q266, fr. 6 iii-iv) and to the agricultural priestly dues
(4Q270, fr. 3 ii-iii; 271, fr. 2; 269, fr. 8 i-ii). (6) A penal code partly
overlapping with 1QS VII follows (4Q266, fr. 10; 270, fr. 7 i; 269, fr. II i-
ii). The two main manuscripts (4Q266, fr. II and 270, fr. 7i-ii) end with
the ritual for the dismissal of unworthy members used in the ceremony
marking entry into and expulsion from the Covenant. This festival was
celebrated in the third month and coincided with the Feast of Weeks or
Pentecost. Finally (7) the hybrid S-D (4Q265), in which the Community
Rule and the Damascus Document merge, allows a glimpse into the
interrelationship between the two main constitutional documents of the
Community.

4Q269, see H. Stegemann, DJD, XXXVI, 201-11.

(1) THE OPENING OF THE DAMASCUS
DOCUMENT ACCORDING TO 4QD
(4Q266-8)
Three Cave 4 manuscripts of the Damascus Document (4Q266, fr. 1a-
b; fr. 2 i, 1-6, combined 4Q267 fr. 1 and 268 fr. 1) have preserved
parts of a prologue unattested in the Cairo version. The prologue
contains a title vaguely reminiscent of the opening of 4QSd. The
context is eschatological and alludes to a revelation by God to those
‘who search His commandments and walk in the perfection of way’.
CD 11,1 follows on directly from the end of the prologue.
4Q266, fr. Ia-b
[For the Master to instruct the s]ons of Light to keep away from the
way[s of wickedness] ... until the completion of the appointed time for
the visitation of [the spirit of injustice] ... God [will destro]y all her
deeds, bringing destruction on ... the removers of boundaries and He
will inflict destruction [on the assembly] of wickedness. [And now listen]
to me and I will let you know the awesome des[igns of God] and His
marvellous [mighty deeds]. I will recount to you [all that is concealed]
from man [all the d]ays of his life...
Fr. 2 (4Q267, fr. 1; 268, fr. 1)
I flesh and creature... until it comes to them for they shall not be either
early or late from their appointed times... He decreed an age of wrath
for the people who did not know Him, and He established appointed
times of goodwill for those who search His commandments and walk
in the perfection of way. And He revealed hidden things to their eyes,
and opened their ears so that they might hear deep (secrets) and


---

## Page 185

understand all future things before they befall them. Listen now, all you
who know righteousness... (=CD 1, 1).
(2) INITIATION RULES
(4Q266, fr. 5)
This fragment contains echoes of the Community Rule’s regulations
regarding admission and dismissal of candidates and CD’s
identification of the sons of Zadok as the ‘converts of Israel’.
I ... ... [that they may bring near] each according to [his] spirit [and
deeds] ... they shall depart by the decision of the Guardian (cf. 1QS VI,
16-17) ... [And these are the precepts] in which all the converts of Israel
[shall wa]lk ... the sons of Zadok, the Priests (cf. CD IV, 2-3), behold
the[y are the converts of Israel... [the interpretation of the] last Law. And
these are the precepts for the Mas[ter] in which [he shall walk (1QS IX,
12)] in regard to all Israel, for [God] shall not save any of those who are
not established] in His ways to walk perfec[tly] ...
(3) RULES RELATING TO THE
DISQUALIFICATION OF PRIESTS
4Q 266, fr. 5 ii (4Q267, fr. 5 ii; 273, frs. 2, 4 i)
In this section of priestly legislation, the Community specifies (I) that
only priests able to speak clearly and distinctly were allowed to read
the Bible in public; (2) that priests who had been war prisoners were
disqualified from Temple service; and (3) that priests who migrated to
Gentile countries were deprived of their leading position and forbidden

to partake in holy things.

(4) DIAGNOSIS OF SKIN DISEASE
(4Q 266,269,272,273)
The rules relating to the diagnosis of a skin disease affecting the scalp
and the face (Lev. xiii, 29-37) are missing from the Cairo manuscripts,
but can be partially reconstructed from 4Q272 and 266 and also from
4Q269 and 273. The introductory formula prefixed to Lev. xiii, 33, viz.,
‘And as for that which is said’, usually indicative of a repeat citation,
suggests that a longer Leviticus quotation preceded it. The skin
disease section is followed by laws relating to various sexual
discharges causing uncleanness and impurity linked with childbirth.

4Q 266, fr. 6 i (4Q272 1 273 ii, 269 7)
I ... a discoloration or a scab or a bright spot ... And the scab resulting
from a blow by wood [or st]one or whatever blow, when the spi[rit]
enters [and sei]zes the artery, and the blood recedes up and down,
and the artery... after the blood ...
[And the priest shall observe the skin, the living and] the dead. If the
dead (skin) [exceeds] the living (skin), he shall lock him up [until the
blood re]turns to the artery until the flesh grows. And the priest shall
observe him and shall make a comparison [on] the seventh [d]ay, [and
if the spirlit of life is moving up and down, and the flesh grows, [the
plague is healed, clean is] the scab. The priest shall not observe the
skin on the flesh.
4Q266, fr. 6
I But if the discoloration or the scab is lower [than the skin... and the
Pr]iest sees it as the appearance of living flesh, it is [a ‘leprosy’ (skin
disease)] which has seized the living skin. And a similar rule
concerning ... the Priest shall see on the seventh day. If some living
flesh has become dead, the leprosy is malignant. And the law for the
scab of the head or the bea[rd, when the Priest shall see] that the spirit
has entered the head and the beard seizing the artery, and [the plague]
spreads from under the hair and turns its appearance to fine yellow; for
it is like a plant which has a worm under it and bites its root and makes
its flower wither. And as for that which is said, And the Priest shall
order that they shave his head, but shall not shave the scab (Lev. xiii,
33). This is in order that the Priest may count the dead and live hair.
And he will see whether anything has been added from the live to the
dead (hair) during the seven days. If there has, he is unclean. But if
nothing has been added from the live (hair) to the dead, and the artery
is filled with bl[ood] and the sp[i]rit of life goes up and down in it, this
plague [is cured]. And this is the rule of the law of ‘leprosy’ for the sons
of Aaron to set apart...

(6) THE PENAL CODE AND THE RENEWAL OF
THE COVENANT RITUAL
(4Q 266,270)
CD XIV ends with scrappy relics of a penal code. The Cave 4
manuscripu Da and De include a list of breaches of the rule punished
by exclusion and penance of varying lengths. They closely resemble
the code contained in the Community Rule (1QS VII). The principal
difference consists in the explicit mention of women (fornication with
one’s wife and murmuring against the Mothers) which once again
renders the silence of Serekh concerning any matter pertaining to the
female sex particularly eloquent. The penal code is followed by a
Covenant ritual, which ends the Cave 4 version of the Damascus
Document and contains the words spoken by the priestly head of the
sect, following the expulsion of the unfaithful members of the
congregation. The passage includes the reference to the ‘third month’
as the date of this festive assembly and presents the message of this
writing as ‘the last interpretation of the Law’.

companion without a reason [shall be exc]luded for one year and do
pe[nan]ce for s[ix months] (cf. 1QS VII, 4). Whoever has spoken a
foolish word, shall do penance for t[wen]ty [days and will be excluded]
for three month[s (cf. 1QS VII, 9). And whoever in]terrupts the w[ords of
his companion and lets himself go, will do penance for ten] days (1QS
VII, 9-10). [And whoever lies do]wn [and] falls asleep at [the mee]t[ing
of the Congregation ... shall be excluded] for thirty days [and] do
penance for ten days. [And likewise, whoever has] left [without the
consent of the Congregation and gratu]itously as many as three ti[mes
in] one [session], he [shall do penance for ten] days. But if he has left
the session [when they were standing, he shall do penance for thir]ty
day[s]. And whoever has walked [naked] before [his] companion,
whether he has walked in the house or in the field, he has walked
n[aked before the peo]ple; he shall be excluded for six [months] ...
(1QS VII, 10-12). And whoever has [d]rawn his hand from under [his]
gar[ment and he was so poorly dressed that his nakedness was seen,
he shall be separated for thir]ty [day]s and shall do penance for ten
(1QS VII, 13-14). And whoever has gu[ffawed foolishly making his
voi]c[e heard, shall be excluded for th]irty (days) and shall do penance
for fif[teen days. And whoever has drawn out] his le[ft h]and [to
gesticu]late with it, shall do penance [for ten days (1QS VII, 14-15).
And who]ever has gone [slandering his com]panion, they shall exclude
him from the purity for one year.

penance for six months (1QS VII, 17-18). And] the m[a]n whose spirit
has so trembled [before the authority of the Community that he has
betrayed the truth and walked in the stubbornness of his heart, he shall
be excluded for two years] and do penance for sixty [days] (1QS VII,

18-19). [When his two years are completed, the Congregation shall
consider [his ca]se, [and if he is admitted,] he shall be ins[cribed in his
rank and may then question about the law (1QS VII, 20—21). And
whoever] has despised the law of the Congregation shall leave and
[shall not return again. And whoever has taken] his food (from another
person) outside the rules, he shall return it to the man fr[om whom] he
has taken it. vacat And whoever has approached his wife, not
according to the rules, (thus) fornicating, he shall leave and will not
return again. [If he has murmured] against the Fathers, he shall leave
and shall not return [again (cf. 1QS VII, 17). But if he has murmured]
against the Mothers, he shall do penance for ten days. For the Mothers
have no rwqmh(distinction ?) within [the Congregation. vacat
And these are the r]ules in [which they shall walk, all those who have
been corrected. Whoev]er comes [to report some]one to the Priest
[over]seeing
4Q 266, fr. II4Q270, fr. 7 i-ii)
II the Congregation, he shall willingly accept His judgement, as He has
ordered by the hand of Moses regarding the soul that sins by
inadvertence that he shall bring his sin-offering and his guilt-offering.
And concerning Israel it is written, I will go to the ends [of] heaven and
will not smell the smell of your sweet odour (Lev. xxvi, 31). And in
another passage it is written, To return to God with crying and fasting
(Joel ii, 13). And in another passage it is written, Rend your heart and
not your garment (ibid.) and it is written to return to God with fasting
and weeping (Joel ii, 12). And whoever rejects these rules which follow
all the precepts found in the Law of Moses, shall not be counted with all
the sons of His truth, for his soul has detested the righteous corrections
(cf. 1QS III, I). As a rebel, he shall be dismissed from the
Congregation. The Priest [over]seeing the Congregation shall speak
about him. Answering, [he shall] say: ‘Blessed art Thou, “Lord” of the
universe. Everything is in Thine hands and Thou art the maker of
everything. Thou hast founded the [pe]oples according to their families
and the languages of their nations. Thou hast made them err in

confusion without a way. And Thou hast chosen our Fathers and hast
given to their seed the precepts of Thy truth and Thine holy judgements
by which a man, if he practises them, shall live. And Thou hast
established boundaries for us and cursed those who transgress them.
And we are the people of Thy redemption and the flock of Thy pasture.
Thou hast cursed those who transgress it (the boundary?) but we
maintain (it).’ And the dismissed man shall leave, and whoever eats
from what is his, and greets (literally, inquires about the welfare –
shalom– of) the man who has been dismissed, and agrees with him,
his case shall be recorded by the Guardian according to the decree,
and his judgement shall be complete. And all [the inhabitants] of the
camps shall assemble in the third month and shall curse him who turns
aside, to the right [or to the left from the] Law. And this (the foregoing)
is the interpretation of the laws which they shall observe in all the age
[of visitation which will be visited on them during al]l the age of wrath
and in their marches for all those who dwell in their camps and all their
towns. Behold all this is according to the last interpretation of the Law.
(7) A HYBRID COMMUNITY RULE – DAMASCUS
DOCUMENT TEXT
(4Q265)
Twelve fragments of a manuscript, dating probably to the end of the
first century BCE, have preserved remains of a writing dependent both
on the Community Rule and on the Damascus Document but also
including material which is in neither of these sources. Fr. I deals with
the initiation into the Community and the penal code in terms recalling
1QS VI-VII, and fr. 7, lines 7-10 contains a description of the Council of
the Community which is an abridged version of 1QS VIII, 1—9. It is
worth noting that the ‘twelve men and three priests’ of 1QS VIII, I is
replaced here by‘fift[een men]’. Elements of the Sabbath laws from CD
XI figure on columns I-II of fr. 7, while on one point the borrowing is


---

## Page 194

probably from the Temple Scroll LII, 17-18. As for material alien to
1QS and CD, fr. 2 cites Isaiah liv, 1-2 in full and the last four lines of fr.
7 ii reproduce Lev. xii, 2, 4a, 5, 4b, but omitting xii, 3. This quotation is
part of an account of the ages of the world arranged according to
weeks, beginning with the garden of Eden.

The Messianic Rule
(1QSa=1Q28a)
The Messianic Rule was published in 1955 by D. Barthélemy in DJD,I
(Oxford, 1955, pp. 107-18). Originally included in the same Scroll as
the Community Rule, this short but complete work presents the
translator with great difficulties owing to its bad state of preservation
and to the carelessness of the scribe.
Barthélemy named the work ‘The Rule of the Congregation’, but I
have given it a new title for the following reasons: (1) it was intended
for ‘all the congregation in the last days’; (2) it is a Rule for a
Community adapted to the requirements of the messianic war against
the nations; (3) it refers to the presence of the Priest and the Messiah
of Israel at the Council, and at the Meal described in column II.
As in the Cave I version of the Community Rule and in the
Damascus Document, but contrary to the version preserved in 4QSd
(=4Q258) and 4QSb (=4Q256), ‘the sons of Zadok, the Priests’ form
the chief authority in the sect.
In the main, the precepts and the doctrinal concepts of the
Messianic Rule foreshadow those of the War Rule. A mid-first-century
BCE date may safely be proposed. Hundreds of tiny papyrus
fragments of this text written in a cryptic script have been found in
Cave 4. However, the pieces are so small that they cannot
independently contribute to the textual criticism of 1QSa. See S. J.
Pfann, 4Q249a-h, DJD, XXXVI, 515-74.
I This is the Rule for all the congregation of Israel in the last days,
when they shall join [the Community to wa]lk according to the law of


---

## Page 198

the sons of Zadok the Priests and of the men of their Covenant who
have turned aside [from the] way of the people, the men of His
Council who keep His Covenant in the midst of iniquity, offering
expiation [for the Land]
When they come, they shall summon them all, the little children and
the women also, and they shall read into their [ears a]ll the precepts of
the Covenant and shall expound to them all their statutes that they may
no longer stray in their [errors].
And this is the Rule for all the hosts of the congregation, for every
man born in Israel
From [his] youth they shall instruct him in the Book of Meditation and
shall teach him, according to his age, the precepts of the Covenant. He
[shall be edu]cated in their statutes for ten years...
At the age of twenty years [he shall be] enrolled, that he may enter
upon his allotted duties in the midst of his family (and) be joined to the
holy congregation. He shall not [approach] a woman to know her by
lying with her before he is fully twenty years old, when he shall know
[good] and evil. And thereafter, he shall be accepted when he calls to
witness the judgements of the Law, and shall be (allowed) to assist at
the hearing of judgements.
At the age of twenty-five years he may take his place among the
foundations (i.e. the officials) of the holy congregation to work in the
service of the congregation.
At the age of thirty years he may approach to participate in lawsuits
and judgements, and may take his place among the chiefs of the
Thousands of Israel, the chiefs of the Hundreds, Fifties, and Tens, the
Judges and the officers of their tribes, in all their families, [under the
authority] of the sons of [Aar]on the Priests. And every head of family in
the congregation who is chosen to hold office, [to go] and come before
the congregation, shall strengthen his loins that he may perform his
tasks among his brethren in accordance with his understanding and
the perfection of his way. According to whether this is great or little, so
shall one man be honoured more than another.
When a man is advanced in years, he shall be given a duty in the
[ser]vice of the congregation in proportion to his strength.
No simpleton shall be chosen to hold office in the congregation of


---

## Page 199

Israel with regard to lawsuits or judgement, nor carry any responsibility
in the congregation. Nor shall he hold any office in the war destined to
vanquish the nations; his family shall merely inscribe him in the army
register and he shall do his service in task-work in proportion to his
capacity.
The sons of Levi shall hold office, each in his place, under the
authority of the sons of Aaron. They shall cause all the congregation to
go and come, each man in his rank, under the direction of the heads of
family of the congregation - the leaders, Judges, and officers,
according to the number of all their hosts - under the authority of the
sons of Zadok the Priests, [and] (under the direction) [of all the] heads
of family of the congregation. And when the whole assembly is
summoned for judgement, or for a Council of the Community, or for
war, they shall sanctify them for three days that every one of its
members may be prepared.
These are the men who shall be called to the Council of the
Community ...
All the wi[se men] of the congregation, the learned and the
intelligent, men whose way is perfect and men of ability, together with
the tribal chiefs and all the Judges and officers, and the chiefs of the
Thousands, [Hundreds,] II Fifties, and Tens, and the Levites, each man
in the [cla]ss of his duty; these are the men of renown, the members of
the assembly summoned to the Council of the Community in Israel
before the sons of Zadok the Priests.
And no man smitten with any human uncleanness shall enter the
assembly of God; no man smitten with any of them shall be confirmed
in his office in the congregation. No man smitten in his flesh, or
paralysed in his feet or hands, or lame, or blind, or deaf, or dumb, or
smitten in his flesh with a visible blemish; no old and tottery man
unable to stay still in the midst of the congregation; none of these shall
come to hold office among the congregation of the men of renown, for
the Angels of Holiness are [with] their [congregation]. Should [one] of
them have something to say to the Council of Holiness, let [him] be
questioned privately; but let him not enter among [the congregation] for
he is smitten.

brethren, the sons] of Aaron the Priests, [those called] to the assembly,
the men of renown; and they shall sit [before him, each man] in the
order of his dignity. And then [the Mess]iah of Israel shall [come], and
the chiefs of the [clans of Israel] shall sit before him, [each] in the order
of his dignity, according to [his place] in their camps and marches. And
before them shall sit all the heads of [family of the congreg]ation, and
the wise men of [the holy congregation,] each in the order of his dignity.
And [when] they shall gather for the common [tab]le, to eat and [to
drink] new wine, when the common table shall be set for eating and the
new wine [poured] for drinking, let no man extend his hand over the
firstfruits of bread and wine before the Priest; for [it is he] who shall
bless the firstfruits of bread and wine, and shall be the first [to extend]
his hand over the bread. Thereafter, the Messiah of Israel shall extend
his hand over the bread, [and] all the congregation of the Community
[shall utter a] blessing, [each man in the order] of his dignity.
It is according to this statute that they shall proceed at every me[al at
which] at least ten men are gathered together.

The War Scroll
(IQM, 1Q33, 4Q491-7, 4Q471)
The nineteen badly mutilated columns of this manuscript from Cave 1
first appeared in 1954 in a posthumous work by E. L. Sukenik, and
were re-edited in 1955, with an English introduction, under the title The
Dead Sea Scrolls of the Hebrew University (Jerusalem). A few
detached scraps are represented by 1Q33 and copious fragments of
six further manuscripts were discovered in Cave 4, and published in
1982 by M. Baillet in DJD, VII (4Q491-6 or 4QMa-f). 4Q497 represents
tiny fragments of a related text, and 4Q471 or 4QMg a shorter version
of 1QM (cf. E. and H. Eshel, DJD, XXXVI, 439-45). For a new edition
of all the War Scroll material except 4Q471 see J. Duhaime in J. H.
Charlesworth et al., eds., The DSS II, Damascus Document, War
Scroll and Related Documents, 1995, 80-203.
Some of the 4Q fragments basically reflect the Cave 1 text and help
to complete its gaps: Ma, Mb, Md and Me have been used for this
purpose, especially in columns I, XIV and XIX. On the other hand, Ma
and Mc attest different recensions of the War Rule. Representative
sections from these manuscripts will be translated separately.
The contents of the War Rule are as follows:
Proclamation of war against the Kittim (I)
Reorganization of Temple worship (II)
Programme of the forty years’ war (II)
The trumpets (III)
The standards (III-IV)
Disposition and weapons of the front formations (v)
Movements of the attacking infantry (VI)
Disposition and movements of the cavalry (VI)
Age of the soldiers (VI-VII)

The camp (VII)
Duties of the Priests and Levites
(exhortation, trumpet signals) (VII-IV)
Addresses and prayers of the battle liturgy (X-XII)
Prayer recited at the moment of victory (XIII)
Thanksgiving ceremony (XIV)
Battle against the Kittim (XV-XIX)
Since the five last columns are more or less repetitious, there has
been some doubt concerning the unity of the composition as a whole.
Those who consider all nineteen columns to be the work of one writer
find in column 1 an introduction, in columns II-XIV general rules, and in
columns XV-XIX a ‘prophetic’ description of the final battle fought
according to those rules. Other experts explain that columns XV-XIX
are a Rule annexe dependent on the principal Rule (II-XIV).
I am myself inclined to follow the theory first advanced by J. van der
Ploeg (Le Rouleau de la guerre, Leiden, 1959, 11-22). The primitive
work, represented in the present composition by columns 1 and XV-
XIX, draws its inspiration from Daniel xi, 40-XII, 3, and describes the
final battle against the Kittim. This account was later combined with the
concept of a holy forty years’ war against the entire Gentile world, and
was extended by the addition of a long series of Rules concerned with
the military and religious preparation and with the conduct of the
fighting (columns II-XIV). This appears to me to offer a more
satisfactory explanation of the literary complexities of the manuscript
than do the previous hypotheses. The text of the manuscripts from
Cave 4, especially Ma (4Q491) and Mc (4Q493)> indicate that diverse
redactions of the War Rule coexisted in the Qumran library.
The only certain pointer to the date of the compilation of the War
Rule is that, since the author made use of the Book of Daniel written
shortly after 164 BCE, his own work must have been started after that
time. But a more accurate dating may be attempted by studying the
military strategy and tactics described in the Scroll. Scholars are
divided in their opinion as to whether the sons of light modelled them
on Greek or Roman custom, or whether they merely drew their ideas
from the Bible. Scripture doubtless exercised a definite influence on


---

## Page 203

the author of this Rule, but there is nevertheless a great deal of
material completely foreign to it, and he must have possessed, in
addition, at least some acquaintance with contemporary warfare.
With Y. Yadin and other archaeologists and historians, I believe that
both the weapons and the tactics of the War Rule correspond to the art
of war practised by the Roman legion rather than by the Greek
phalanx. In particular, the square shield (scutum) of the foot-soldier,
and the buckler of the horseman (parma or clipeus), the battle array of
three lines (acies triplex), the ‘gates of war’ or openings between the
units (intervalla), seem to be characteristically Roman. In addition, only
the cavalry were to wear greaves - a custom introduced into the
Roman army during the time of Julius Caesar in the middle of the first
century BCE. This and similar details, as well as the general
representation of the Kittim as masters of the world, lead one to
conclude that the War Rule was written some time after the middle of
the first century BCE, and since the reference to the ‘king’ of the Kittim
points to the Imperial epoch (after 27 BCE), the date of its composition
should probably be placed in the last decades of the first century BCE
or at the beginning of the first century CE.
This work should not be mistaken for a manual of military warfare
pure and simple. It is a theological writing, and the war of which it
treats symbolizes the eternal struggle between the spirits of Light and
Darkness. The phases of its battle are fixed in advance, its plan
established and its duration predetermined. The opposing forces are
equally matched and only by the intervention of ‘the mighty hand of
God’ is the balance between them to be disturbed when he deals an
‘everlasting blow’ to ‘Belial and all the host of his kingdom’.
I For the M[aster. The Rule of] War on the unleashing of the attack of
the sons of light against the company of the sons of darkness, the
army of Belial: against the band of Edom, Moab,and the sons
ofAmmon, and [against the army of the sons of the East and] the
Philistines, and against the bands of the Kittim of Assyriaand their
allies the ungodly of the Covenant.
The sons of Levi, Judah, and Benjamin, the exiles in the desert, shall
battle against them in ... all their bands when the exiled sons of light

return from the Desert of the Peoples to camp in the Desert of
Jerusalem; and after the battle they shall go up from there (to
Jerusalem?).
[The king] of the Kittim [shall enter] into Egypt, and in his time he
shall set out in great wrath to wage war against the kings of the north,
that his fury may destroy and cut the horn of [Israel]. This shall be a time
of salvation for the people of God, an age of dominion for all the
members of His company, and of everlasting destruction for all the
company of Belial. The confusion of the sons of Japheth shall be
[great] and Assyria shall fall unsuccoured. The dominion of the Kittim
shall come to an end and iniquity shall be vanquished, leaving no
remnant; [for the sons] of darkness there shall be no escape. [The sons
of righteous]ness shall shine over all the ends of the earth; they shall go
on shining until all the seasons of darkness are consumed and, at the
season appointed by God, His exalted greatness shall shine eternally
to the peace, blessing, glory, joy, and long life of all the sons of light.
On the day when the Kittim fall, there shall be battle and terrible
carnage before the God of Israel, for that shall be the day appointed
from ancient times for the battle of destruction of the sons of darkness.
At that time, the assembly of gods and the hosts of men shall battle,
causing great carnage; on the day of calamity, the sons of light shall
battle with the company of darkness amid the shouts of a mighty
multitude and the clamour of gods and men to (make manifest) the
might of God. And it shall be a time of [great] tribulation for the people
which God shall redeem; of all its afflictions none shall be as this, from
its sudden beginning until its end in eternal redemption.
On the day of their battle against the Kittim [they shall set out for]
carnage. In three lots shall the sons of light brace themselves in battle
to strike down iniquity, and in three lots shall Belial’s host gird itself to
thrust back the company [of God. And when the hearts of the
detach]ments of foot-soldiers faint, then shall the might of God fortify
[the hearts of the sons of light]. And with the seventh lot, the mighty
hand of God shall bring down [the army of Belial, and all] the angels of
his kingdom, and all the members [of his company in everlasting
destruction] ...

They shall rank the chief Priests below the High Priest and his vicar.
And the twelve chief Priests shall minister at the daily sacrifice before
God, whereas the twenty-six leaders of the priestly divisions shall
minister in their divisions.
Below them, in perpetual ministry, shall be the chiefs of the Levites

and over.
These are the men who shall attend at holocausts and sacrifices to
prepare sweet-smelling incense for the good pleasure of God, to
atone for all His congregation, and to satisfy themselves perpetually
before Him at the table of glory. They shall arrange all these things
during the season of the year of Release.
During the remaining thirty-three years of the war, the men of
renown, those summoned to the Assembly, together with all the heads
of family of the congregation, shall choose for themselves fighting-men
for all the lands of the nations. They shall arm for themselves warriors
from all the tribes of Israel to enter the army year by year when they are
summoned to war. But they shall arm no man for entry into the army
during the years of Release, for they are Sabbaths of rest for Israel. In
the thirty-five years of service, the war shall be fought during six; the
whole congregation shall fight it together. And during the remaining
twenty-nine years the war shall be divided. During the first year they
shall fight against Aram-Naharaim; during the second, against the
sons of Lud; during the third, against the remnant of the sons of Aram,
against Uz and Hul and Togar and Mesha beyond the Euphrates;
during the fourth and fifth, they shall fight against the sons of
Arpachshad; during the sixth and seventh, against all the sons of
Assyria and Persia and the East as far as the Great Desert; during the

against the sons of Ishmael and Keturah. In the ten years which follow,

clans and in their ha]bitations; and during the ten years which remain,
the war shall be divided against all [the sons of Japheth in] their
habitations.

The formation shall consist of one thousand men ranked seven lines
deep, each man standing behind the other.
They shall all hold shields of bronze burnished like mirrors. The
shield shall be edged with an interlaced border and with inlaid
ornament, a work of art in pure gold and silver and bronze and
precious stones, a many-coloured design worked by a craftsman. The
length of the shield shall be two and a half cubits and its width one and
a half cubits.
In their hands they shall hold a spear and a sword. The length of the
spear shall be seven cubits, of which the socket and spike shall

VI seven times and shall return to their positions.
And after them, three divisions of foot-soldiers shall advance and
shall station themselves between the formations, and the first division
shall hurl seven javelins of war towards the enemy formation. On the
point of the javelins they shall write, ShiningJavelinof the Power of
God; and on the darts of the second division they shall write, Bloody
Spikes to Bring Down the Slain by the Wrath of God; and on the
javelins of the third division they shall write, Flaming Blade to Devour
the Wicked Struck Down by the Judgement of God. All these shall hurl
their javelins seven times and shall afterwards return to their positions.
Then two divisions of foot-soldiers shall advance and shall station
themselves between the two formations. The first division shall be
armed with a spear and a shield, and the second with a shield and a
sword, to bring down the slain by the judgement of God, and to bend
the enemy formation by the power of God, to pay the reward of their
wickedness to all the nations of vanity. And sovereignty shall be to the
God of Israel, and He shall accomplish mighty deeds by the saints of
his people.
Seven troops of horsemen shall also station themselves to the right
and to the left of the formation; their troops shall stand on this (side)
and on that, seven hundred horsemen on one flank and seven hundred

## Page 211

horsemen on the other. Two hundred horsemen shall advance with the
thousand men of the formation of foot-soldiers; and they shall likewise
station themselves on both [flanks] of the camp. Altogether there shall
be four thousand six hundred (men), and one thousand cavalrymen
with the men of the army formations, fifty to each formation. The
horsemen, together with the cavalry of the army shall number six
thousand: five hundred to each tribe.
The horses advancing into battle with the foot-soldiers shall all be
stallions; they shall be swift, sensitive of mouth, and sound of wind, and
of the required age, trained for war, and accustomed to noise and to
every (kind of) sight. Their riders shall be gallant fighting men and
skilled horsemen, and their age shall be from thirty to forty-five years.
The horsemen of the army shall be from forty to fifty years old. They
[and their mounts shall wear breast-plates,] helmets, and greaves; they
shall carry in their hands bucklers, and a spear [eight cubits] long. [The
horseman advancing with the foot-soldiers shall carry] bows and
arrows and javelins of war. They shall all hold themselves prepared ...
of God and to spill the blood of the wicked ...
VII The men of the army shall be from forty to fifty years old. The
inspectors of the camps shall be from fifty to sixty years old. The
officers shall be from forty to fifty years old. The despoilers of the slain,
the plunderers of booty, the cleansers of the land, the keepers of the
baggage, and those who furnish the provisions shall be from twenty-
five to thirty years old.
No boy or woman shall enter their camps, from the time they leave
Jerusalem and march out to war until they return. No man who is lame,
or blind, or crippled, or afflicted with a lasting bodily blemish, or smitten
with a bodily impurity, none of these shall march out to war with them.
They shall all be freely enlisted for war, perfect in spirit and body and
prepared for the Day of Vengeance. And no man shall go down with
them on the day of battle who is impure because of his ‘fount’, for the
holy angels shall be with their hosts. And there shall be a space of
about two thousand cubits between all their camps for the place

serving as a latrine, so that no indecent nakedness may be seen in the
surroundings of their camps.
When the battle formations are marshalled facing the enemy
formation facing formation, seven Priests of the sons of Aaron shall
advance from the middle gates to the place between the formations.
They shall be clothed in vestments of white cloth of flax, in a fine linen
tunic and fine linen breeches; and they shall be girdled with fine cloth of
flax embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet thread, a many-
coloured design worked by a craftsman. And on their heads they shall
wear mitred turbans. These shall be battle raiment; they shall not take
them into the Sanctuary.
The first Priest shall advance before the men of the formation to
strengthen their hand for battle, and the six other Priests shall hold in
their hands the trumpets of Summons, and the trumpets of the
Reminder, and the trumpets of Alarm (for massacre), and the trumpets
of Pursuit, and the trumpets of Retreat. And when the Priests advance
to the place between the formations, seven Levites shall accompany
them bearing in their hands seven rams’ horns; and three officers of
the Levites shall walk before the Priests and Levites. The Priests shall
sound the two trumpets of Sum[mons for the gates of] war to open fifty
shields (wide) and the foot-soldiers shall advance, fifty from one gate
[and fifty from the other. With them shall advance] the officers of the
Levites, and they shall advance with every formation according to all
this R[ule].
[The Priests shall sound the trumpets, and two divisions of foot-]
soldiers [shall advance] from the gate [and shall] station [themselves]
between the two [formations] ... VIII the trumpets shall sound to direct
the slingers until they have cast seven times. Afterwards, the Priests
shall sound for them the trumpets of Retreat and they shall return to the
flank of the first formation to take up their position.
Then the Priests shall sound the trumpets of Summons and three
divisions of foot-soldiers shall advance from the gates and shall station
themselves between the formations; the horsemen shall be on their
flanks, to the right and to the left. The Priests shall sound a sustained
blast on the trumpets for battle array, and the columns shall move to


---

## Page 213

their (battle) array, each man to his place. And when they have taken
up their stand in three arrays, the Priests shall sound a second signal,
soft and sustained, for them to advance until they are close to the
enemy formation. They shall seize their weapons, and the Priests shall
then blow a shrill staccato blast on the six trumpets of Massacre to
direct the battle, and the Levites and all the blowers of rams’ horns
shall sound a mighty alarm to terrify the heart of the enemy, and
therewith the javelins shall fly out to bring down the slain. Then the
sound of the horns shall cease, but the Priests shall continue to blow a
shrill staccato blast on the trumpets to direct the battle until they have
thrown seven times against the enemy formation. And then they shall
sound a soft, a sustained, and a shrill sound on the trumpets of
Retreat.
It is according to this Rule that the Priests shall sound the trumpets
for the three divisions. With the first throw, the [Priests] shall sound [on
the trumpets] a mighty alarm to direct the ba[ttle until they have thrown
seven times. Then] the Priests [shall sound] for them on the trumpets
[of Retreat a soft, a sustained, and a shrill sound, and they shall return]
to their positions in the formation.
[Then the Priests shall blow the trumpets of Summons and the two
divisions of foot-soldiers shall advance from the gates] and shall stand
[between the formations. And the Priests shall then blow the trumpets
of] Massacre, [and the Levites and all the blowers of rams’ horns shall
sound an alarm, a mighty blast, and therewith] IX they shall set about to
bring down the slain with their hands. All the people shall cease their
clamour but the Priests shall continue to blow the trumpets of
Massacre to direct the battle until the enemy is smitten and put to flight;
and the Priests shall blow to direct the battle.
And when they are smitten before them, the Priests shall sound the
trumpets of Summons and all the foot-soldiers shall rally to them from
the midst of the front formations, and the six divisions, together with the
fighting division, shall take up their stations. Altogether, they shall be
seven formations: twenty-eight thousand fighting men and six thousand
horsemen.
All these shall pursue the enemy to destroy him in an everlasting
destruction in the battle of God. The Priests shall sound for them the


---

## Page 214

trumpets of Pursuit, and they shall deploy against all the enemy in a
pursuit to destruction; and the horsemen shall thrust them back on the
flanks of the battle until they are utterly destroyed.
And as the slain men fall, the Priests shall trumpet from afar; they
shall not approach the slain lest they be defiled with unclean blood. For
they are holy, and they shall not profane the anointing of their
priesthood with the blood of nations of vanity.
The Rule for changes in battle order to form the position of a squa[re
with towers], a concave line with towers, a convex line with towers, a
shallow convex line obtained by the advance of the centre, or (by the
advance of) both flanks to terrify the enemy
The shields of the towers shall be three cubits long and their spears
eight cubits. The tower shall advance from the formation and shall have
one hundred shields to each side; in this [manner,] the tower shall be
surrounded on three sides by three hundred shields. And it shall also
have two gates, [one to the right] and one to the left.
They shall write on all the shields of the towers: on the first, Michael,
[on the second, Gabriel, on the third,] Sariel, and on the fourth,
Raphael. Michael and Gabriel [shall stand on the right, and Sariel and
Raphael on the left] ... they shall set an ambush to...
... X our camps and to keep us from all that is indecent and evil.
Furthermore, (Moses) taught us, ‘Thou art in the midst of us, a
mighty God and terrible, causing all our enemies to flee before [us].’
He taught our generations in former times saying, When you draw
near to battle, the Priest shall rise and speak to the people saying,
Hear, O Israel! You draw near to battle this day against your
enemies. Do not fear! Do not let your hearts be afraid! Do not be
[terrified], and have no fear! For your God goes with you to fight for
you against your enemies that He may deliver you’ (Deut. XX, 2-4).
Our officers shall speak to all those prepared for battle. They shall
strengthen by the power of God the freely devoted of heart, and shall
make all the fearful of heart withdraw; they shall fortify all the mighty
men of war. They shall recount that which Thou [saidst] through Moses:
When you go to war in your land against the oppressor who
oppresses you, [you] shall blow the trumpets, and you shall be

remembered before your God and shall be saved from your enemies
(Num. x, 9).

Who accomplishes deeds and mighty works like Thine?
Who is like Thy people Israel

and learned in wisdom ...
who have heard the voice of Majesty

(Thou art Creator of) the earth
and of the laws dividing it into desert and grassland;
of all that it brings forth
and of all its fruits [according to their kinds;]
of the circle of the seas
and of the gathering-place of the rivers

and of the shape of Adam

of the dwelling in clans
and of the inheritance of lands;
...of the sacred seasons
and of the cycles of the years
and of time everlasting.
XI Truly the battle is Thine! Their bodies are crushed by the might of
Thy hand and there is no man to bury them.
Thou didst deliver Goliath of Gath, the mighty warrior, into the hands
of David Thy servant, because in place of the sword and in place of the
spear he put his trust in Thy great Name; for Thine is the battle. Many
times, by Thy great Name, did he triumph over the Philistines. Many
times hast Thou also delivered us by the hand of our kings through Thy
loving-kindness, and not in accordance with our works by which we
have done evil, nor according to our rebellious deeds.
Truly the battle is Thine and the power from Thee! It is not ours. Our
strength and the power of our hands accomplish no mighty deeds
except by Thy power and by the might of Thy great valour. This Thou
hast taught us from ancient times, saying, A star shall come out of
Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel. He shall smite the
temples of Moab and destroy all the children of Sheth. He shall rule
out of Jacob and shall cause the survivors of the city to perish. The
enemy shall be his possession and Israel shall accomplish mighty
deeds (Num. xxiv, 17-19).
By the hand of Thine anointed, who discerned Thy testimonies, Thou
hast revealed to us the [times] of the battles of Thy hands that Thou
mayest glorify Thyself in our enemies by levelling the hordes of Belial,
the seven nations of vanity, by the hand of Thy poor whom Thou hast
redeemed [by Thy might] and by the fullness of Thy marvellous power.
(Thou hast opened) the door of hope to the melting heart: Thou wilt do
to them as Thou didst to Pharaoh, and to the captains of his chariots in
the Red Sea. Thou wilt kindle the downcast of spirit and they shall be a
flaming torch in the straw to consume ungodliness and never to cease
till iniquity is destroyed.
From ancient times Thou hast fore[told the hour] when the might of
Thy hand (would be raised) against the Kittim, saying, Assyria shall


---

## Page 217

fall by the sword of no man, the sword of no mere man shall devour
him (Isa. xxxi, 8). For Thou wilt deliver into the hands of the poor the
enemies from all the lands, to humble the mighty of the peoples by the
hand of those bent to the dust, to bring upon the [head of Thine
enemies] the reward of the wicked, and to justify Thy true judgement in
the midst of all the sons of men, and to make for Thyself an everlasting
Name among the people [whom Thou hast redeemed] ... of battles to
be magnified and sanctified in the eyes of the remnant of the peoples,
that they may know... when Thou chastisest Gog and all his assembly
gathered about him ...
For Thou wilt fight with them from heaven... XII For the multitude of
the Holy Ones [is with Thee] in heaven, and the host of the Angels is in
Thy holy abode, praising Thy Name. And Thou hast established in [a
community] for Thyself the elect of Thy holy people. [The list] of the
names of all their host is with Thee in the abode of Thy holiness; [the
reckoning of the saints] is in Thy glorious dwelling-place. Thou hast
recorded for them, with the graving-tool of life, the favours of [Thy]
blessings and the Covenant of Thy peace, that Thou mayest reign
[over them] for ever and ever and throughout all the eternal ages. Thou
wilt muster the [hosts of] Thine [el]ect, in their Thousands and Myriads,
with Thy Holy Ones [and with all] Thine Angels, that they may be mighty
in battle, [and may smite] the rebels of the earth by Thy great
judgements, and that [they may triumph] together with the elect of
heaven.
For Thou art [terrible], O God, in the glory of Thy kingdom, and the
congregation of Thy Holy Ones is among us for everlasting succour.
We will despise kings, we will mock and scorn the mighty; for our Lord
is holy, and the King of Glory is with us together with the Holy Ones.
Valiant [warriors] of the angelic host are among our numbered men,
and the Hero of war is with our congregation; the host of His spirits is
with our foot-soldiers and horsemen. [They are as] clouds, as clouds of
dew (covering) the earth, as a shower of rain shedding judgement on
all that grows on the earth.
Rise up, O Hero!
Lead off Thy captives, O Glorious One!


---

## Page 218

Gather up Thy spoils, O Author of mighty deeds!
Lay Thy hand on the neck of Thine enemies
and Thy feet on the pile of the slain!
Smite the nations, Thine adversaries,
and devour the flesh of the sinner with Thy sword!
Fill Thy land with glory
and Thine inheritance with blessing!
Let there be a multitude of cattle in Thy fields,
and in Thy palaces silver and gold and precious stones!
O Zion, rejoice greatly!
O Jerusalem, show thyself amidst jubilation!
Rejoice, all you cities of Judah;
keep your gates ever open
that the hosts of the nations
may be brought in!
Their kings shall serve you
and all your oppressors shall bow down before you;
[they shall lick] the dust [of your feet].
Shout for joy, [O daughters of] my people!
Deck yourselves with glorious jewels
and rule over [the kingdoms of the nations!
Sovereignty shall be to the Lord]
and everlasting dominion to Israel.
... XIII (The High Priest) shall come, and his brethren the Priests and
the Levites, and all the elders of the army shall be with him; and
standing, they shall bless the God of Israel and all His works of truth,
and shall execrate Belial there and all the spirits of his company.
Speaking, they shall say:
Blessed be the God of Israel for all His holy purpose and for His
works of truth! Blessed be all those who [serve] Him in righteousness
and who know Him by faith!
Cursed be Belial for his sinful purpose and may he be execrated for
his wicked rule! Cursed be all the spirits of his company for their


---

## Page 219

ungodly purpose and may they be execrated for all their service of
uncleanness!
Truly they are the company of Darkness, but the company of God is
one of [eternal] Light.
[Thou art] the God of our fathers; we bless Thy Name for ever. We
are the people of Thine [inheritance]; Thou didst make a Covenant with
our fathers, and wilt establish it with their children throughout eternal
ages. And in all Thy glorious testimonies there has been a reminder of
Thy mercies among us to succour the remnant, the survivors of Thy
Covenant, that they might [recount] Thy works of truth and the
judgements of Thy marvellous mighty deeds.
Thou hast created us for Thyself, [O God], that we may be an
everlasting people. Thou hast decreed for us a destiny of Light
according to Thy truth. And the Prince of Light Thou hast appointed
from ancient times to come to our support; [all the sons of
righteousness are in his hand], and all the spirits of truth are under his
dominion. But Belial, the Angel of Malevolence, Thou hast created for
the Pit; his [rule] is in Darkness and his purpose is to bring about
wickedness and iniquity. All the spirits of his company, the Angels of
Destruction, walk according to the precepts of Darkness; towards
them is their [inclination].
But let us, the company of Thy truth, rejoice in Thy mighty hand and
be glad for Thy salvation, and exult because of Thy suc[cour and]
peace. O God of Israel, who can compare with Thee in might? Thy
mighty hand is with the poor. Which angel or prince can compare with
Thy [redeeming] succour? [For Thou hast appointed] the day of battle
from ancient times ... [to come to the aid] of truth and to destroy
iniquity, to bring Darkness low and to magnify Light ... to stand for ever,
and to destroy all the sons of Darkness ...
... XIV like the fire of His wrath against the idols of Egypt.
And when they have risen from the slain to return to the camp, they
shall all sing the Psalm of Return. And in the morning, they shall wash
their garments, and shall cleanse themselves of the blood of the
bodies of the ungodly. And they shall return to the positions in which
they stood in battle formation before the fall of the enemy slain, and


---

## Page 220

there they shall all bless the God of Israel. Rejoicing together, they shall
praise His Name, and speaking they shall say:
Blessed be the God of Israel
who keeps mercy towards His Covenant,
and the appointed times of salvation
with the people He has delivered!
He has called them that staggered
to [marvellous mighty deeds],
and has gathered in the assembly of the nations
to destruction without any remnant.
He has lifted up in judgement the fearful of heart
and has opened the mouth of the dumb
that they might praise {the mighty} (4Q491) works [of God].
He has taught war [to the hand] of the feeble
and steadied the trembling knee;
he has braced the back of the smitten.
Among the poor in spirit [there is power]
over the hard of heart,
and by the perfect of way
all the nations of wickedness have come to an end:
not one of their mighty men stands,
but we are the remnant [of Thy people.]
{Blessed be} (4Q491) Thy Name, O God of mercies,
who hast kept the Covenant with our fathers.
In all our generations Thou hast bestowed
Thy wonderful favours on the remnant [of Thy people]
under the dominion of Belial.
During all the mysteries of his Malevolence
he has not made [us] stray from Thy Covenant;
Thou hast driven his spirits [of destruction]
far from [us],
Thou hast preserved the soul of Thy redeemed
[when the men] of his dominion {acted wickedly) (4Q491).


---

## Page 221

Thou hast raised the fallen by Thy strength,
but hast cut down the great in height
[and hast brought down the lofty].
There is no rescue for all their mighty men
and no refuge for their swift men;
Thou givest to their honoured men a reward of shame,
all their empty existence [hast Thou turned to nothing].
But we, Thy holy people, will praise Thy Name
because of the works of Thy truth.
We will exalt Thy splendour because of Thy mighty deeds
[in all the] seasons and appointed times for ever,
at the coming of day and at nightfall
and at the departure of evening and morning.
For great {is the design of Thy glory} (4Q49I)
and of Thy wonderful mysteries on high
that [Thou shouldst raise up] dust before Thee
and lay low the ‘gods’.
Rise up, rise up, O God of gods,
raise Thyself in mig{ht, King of Kings} (4.Q491)!
May all the sons of Darkness [scatter before Thee]!
The light of Thy greatness [shall shine forth]
[on ‘go] ds’ and men.
[It shall be like a fire bur]ning
in the dark places of perdition;
it shall burn the sinners in the perdition of hell,
in an eternal blaze
... in all the eternal seasons.
They shall recite there [all the] war [hy]mns. Afterwards they shall
return to [their] cam[ps] ... XV For this shall be a time of distress for
Israel, [and of the summons] to war against all the nations. There shall
be eternal deliverance for the company of God, but destruction for all
the nations of wickedness.
All those [who are ready] for battle shall march out and shall pitch

## Page 222

their camp before the king of the Kittim and before all the host of Belial
gathered about him for the Day [of Revenge] by the Sword of God.
Then the High Priest shall rise, with the [Priests], his brethren, and
the Levites, and all the men of the army, and he shall recite aloud the
Prayer in Time of War [written in the Book] of the Rule concerning this
time, and also all their Hymns. He shall marshal all the formations
there, as is [written in the Book of War], and the priest appointed for
the Day of Revenge by the voice of all his brethren shall go forward to
strengthen the [hearts of the fighting men]. Speaking, he shall say:
Be strong and valiant; be warriors! Fear not! Do not be [confused
and do not let your hearts be afraid!] Do not be fearful; fear them not!
Do not fall back ... for they are a congregation of wickedness and all
their works are in Darkness; they tend towards Darkness. [They make
for themselves] a refuge [in falsehood] and their power shall vanish like
smoke. All the multitudes of their community... shall not be found.
Damned as they are, all the substance of their wickedness shall
quickly fade, like a flower in [the summer-time].
[Be brave and] strong for the battle of God! For this day is [the time
of the battle of] God against all the host of Belial, [and of the judgement
of] all flesh. The God of Israel lifts His hand in His marvellous [might]
against all the spirits of wickedness. [The hosts of] the warrior ‘gods’
gird themselves for battle, [and the] formations of the Holy Ones
[prepare themselves], for the Day [of Revenge] ... XVI... For the God of
Israel has called out the sword against all the nations, and He will do
mighty deeds by the saints of His people.
And they shall obey all this Rule [on] the [day] when they stand
before the camps of the Kittim
The Priests shall afterwards sound for them the trumpets of the
Reminder, and the gates of war shall open; the foot-soldiers shall
advance and the columns shall station themselves between the
formations. The Priests shall sound for them the signal, ‘Battle Array’,
and at the sound of the trumpets the columns [shall deploy] until every
man is in his place. The Priests shall then sound a second signal [for
them to advance], and when they are within throwing distance of the
formation of the Kittim, each man shall seize his weapon of war. Then


---

## Page 223

the six [Priests shall blow on] the trumpets of Massacre a shrill
staccato blast to direct the battle, and the Levites and all the blowers of
rams’ horns shall sound [a battle alarm], a mighty clamour; and with
this clamour they shall begin to bring down the slain from among the
Kittim. All the people shall cease their clamour, [but the Priests shall
continue to] sound the trumpets of Massacre, and battle shall be fought
against the Kittim (vacat). And when [Belial] girds himself to come to
the aid of the sons of darkness, and when the slain among the foot-
soldiers begin to fall by the mysteries of God, and when all the men
appointed for battle are put to ordeal by them, the Priests shall sound
the trumpets of Summons for another formation of the reserve to
advance into battle; and they shall take up their stand between the
formations. And for those engaged [in battle] they shall sound the
‘Retreat’.
Then the High Priest shall draw near, and standing before the
formation, he shall strengthen by the power of God their hearts [and
hands] in His battle. Speaking he shall say: ... the slain, for you have
heard from ancient times through the mysteries of God ...
... XVII He will pay their reward with burning [fire by the hand of]
those tested in the crucible. He will sharpen His weapons and will not
tire until all the wicked nations are destroyed. Remember the
judgement [of Nadab and Ab]ihu, sons of Aaron, by whose judgement
God showed Himself holy in the eyes [of Israel. But Eleazar] and
Ithamar He confirmed in an everlasting [priestly] Covenant.
Be strong and fear not; [for they tend] towards chaos and confusion,
and they lean on that which is not and [shall not be. To the God] of
Israel belongs all that is and shall be; [He knows] all the happenings of
eternity. This is the day appointed by Him for the defeat and overthrow
of the Prince of the kingdom of wickedness, and He will send eternal
succour to the company of His redeemed by the might of the princely
Angel of the kingdom of Michael. With everlasting light He will
enlighten with joy [the children] of Israel; peace and blessing shall be
with the company of God. He will raise up the kingdom of Michael in
the midst of the gods, and the realm of Israel in the midst of all flesh.
Righteousness shall rejoice on high, and all the children of His truth
shall jubilate in eternal knowledge. And you, the sons of His Covenant,


---

## Page 224

be strong in the ordeal of God! His mysteries shall uphold you until He
moves His hand for His trials to come to an end.
After these words, the Priests shall sound to marshal them into the
divisions of the formation; and at the sound of the trumpets the
columns shall deploy until [every man is] in his place. Then the Priests
shall sound a second signal on the trumpets for them to advance, and
when the [foot-]soldiers approach throwing distance of the formation of
the Kittim, every man shall seize his weapon of war. The Priests shall
blow the trumpets of Massacre, [and the Levites and all] the blowers of
rams’ horns shall sound a battle alarm, and the foot-soldiers shall
stretch out their hands against the host of the Kittim; [and at the sound
of the alarm] they shall begin to bring down the slain. All the people
shall cease their clamour, but the Priests shall continue to blow [the
trumpets of Massacre and battle shall be fought against the Kittim.]
... and in the third lot ... that the slain may fall [by the mysteries] of
God ... XVIII [In the seventh lot] when the great hand of God is raised in
an everlasting blow against Belial and all the hosts of his kingdom, and
when Assyria is pursued [amidst the shouts of Angels] and the clamour
of the Holy Ones, the sons of Japheth shall fall to rise no more. The
Kittim shall be crushed without [remnant, and no man shall be saved
from among them].
[At that time, on the day] when the hand of the God of Israel is raised
against all the multitude of Belial, the Priests shall blow [the six
trumpets] of the Reminder and all the battle formations shall rally to
them and shall divide against all the [camps of the] Kittim to destroy
them utterly. [And as] the sun speeds to its setting on that day, the High
Priest shall stand, together [with the Levites] who are with him and the
[tribal] chiefs [and the elders] of the army, and they shall bless the God
of Israel there. Speaking they shall say:
Blessed be Thy Name, O God [of gods], for Thou hast worked great
marvels [with Thy people]! Thou hast kept Thy Covenant with us from of
old, and hast opened to us the gates of salvation many times. For the
[sake of Thy Covenant Thou hast removed our misery, in accordance
with] Thy [goodness] towards us. Thou hast acted for the sake of Thy
Name, O God of righteousness ... [Thou hast worked a marvellous]
miracle [for us], and from ancient times there never was anything like it.

## Page 225

For Thou didst know the time appointed for us and it has appeared
[before us] this day ... [Thou hast shown] us [Thy merciful hand] in
everlasting redemption by causing [the dominion of] the enemy to fall
back for ever. (Thou hast shown us) Thy mighty hand in [a stroke of
destruction in the war against all] our enemies.
And now the day speeds us to the pursuit of their multitude ... Thou
hast delivered up the hearts of the brave so that they stand no more.
For Thine is the power, and the battle is in Thy hands! ... XIX For our
Sovereign is holy and the King of Glory is with us; the [host of his
spirits is with our foot-soldiers and horsemen. They are as clouds, as
clouds of dew] covering the earth, and as a shower of rain shedding
righteousness on [all that grows there].
[Rise up, O Hero!
Lead off Thy captives, O Glorious One!
Gather up] Thy spoils, O Author of mighty deeds!
Lay Thy hand on the neck of Thine enemies
and Thy feet [on the pile of the slain!
Smite the nations, Thine adversaries],
and devour flesh with Thy sword!
Fill Thy land with glory
and Thine inheritance with blessing!
[Let there be a multitude of cattle in Thy fields,
and in] Thy palaces
[silver and gold and precious stones]!
O Zion, rejoice greatly!
Rejoice all you cities of Judah!
[Keep your gates ever open
that the] hosts of the nations
[may be brought in]!
Their kings shall serve you
and all your oppressors shall bow down before you;
[they shall lick the dust of your feet.

Assyria, and the hosts of all the [assembled] nations {to discover

Priest shall draw near, [with his vicar, and the chief Priests] {and the

The War Scroll from Cave 4
(4Q491, 493)
Of the two groups of fragments belonging to Ma (4Q491), the first
echoes sections from columns II, VII, XVI and XVII of 1QM, but it also
contains passages without parallels there. The second unit, a poem,
entitled by the editor ‘The Song of Michael and of the Just’, is
additional to 1QM.
As for the manuscript designated Mc (4Q493), its surviving lines
recall 1QM VII, xvi, etc., but do not represent the same recension.
Ma = 4Q491, frs. 1-3
... There shall be one thousand cubits between the [camp and the
latrine and] no nakedness [whatever] shall be seen in their
surroundings. And when they set out to prepare the battle [to cur]b [the
enemy, there shall be] among them some exempted in the lot of each
tribe according to their numbered men for [each] day’s duty. On that
day, some men from all their tribes shall set out from their camps
towards the House of Meeting ... the [Priest]s, the Levites, and all the
chiefs of the camps shall go out towards them. They will pass there
before ... according to the Thousands, Hundreds, Fifties and Tens.
Whoever shall not [be clean because of his ‘fount’ on] that [nig]ht shall
not go with them to the battle, for the holy angels shall be with their
formations together ... When the formation called up for that day’s
battle to pass to all ... of the war, three formations shall stand,
formations behind formations. They shall set a space between [all] the
formations [and they shall go out] to battle in succession. These are the
[foot-soldie]rs and beside them the [horse]men. [They shall stand

The Book of War
(4Q285, 11Q14)
A collection of ten small fragments, designated by J. T. Milik as
Serekh ha-Milhamah or Rule of War, are akin to the War Scroll,
probably representing its missing end section. Allusions are found to
Levites blowing trumpets (fr. 8), to the archangel Michael (fr. 10), to the
Prince of the Congregation, identified as the Branch of David (frs. 4
and 7), as well as to the Kittim and their slain (frs. 2, 4, 7), all familiar
from 1QM. The poorly preserved benediction (fr. 8) can be
reconstructed with the help of 11Q14 which contains, however, some
notable variants. Fragment 4 seems to identify the defeated opponent
as the biblical Gog (Ezek. xxxix), the chief foe of the final age, here no
doubt equated with the king of the Kittim. Fragment 7, erroneously
labelled by some as the ‘Pierced Messiah fragment’, is based on an
interpretation of Isa. x, 34-xi, 1, and should be read in connection with
4Q161, frs. 8-10, an Isaiah Commentary from Cave 4, and the
Blessing of the Prince of the Congregation (1QSb, v, 20-29), both
referring to the triumphant Davidic Messiah, expected to put an
opponent, no doubt the king of the Kittim, to death. Only frs. 1, 4, 7 and
8 are suitable for translation.
For the editioprinceps, see P. S. Alexander and G. Vermes, DJD,
XXXVI, 228-46. For 11Q14, see F. García Martinez et a/., DJD, XXIII,
243-51. For a preliminary study, see G. Vermes, ‘The Oxford Forum
for Qumran Research: Seminar on the Rule of War (4Q285)’, JJS 43
(1992), 85-90.

The Temple Scroll
(11QT=11Q19-21, 4Q365a, 4Q524)
Discovered in 1956 in Cave II, the Temple Scroll did not emerge from
semi-clandestinity until the Six Day War in June 1967. It is the longest
Qumran manuscript, measuring over twenty-eight feet. There are also
other fragments pertaining to the same document from Cave 11
(11Q20) and from Cave 4 (4Q365a). Originally it consisted of sixty-
seven columns.
The major part of the scroll deals with the Temple (building and
furniture) and cultic worship, especially sacrifices on Sabbaths and the
many feasts of the year. Most of the legislation depends, directly or
indirectly, on Exodus, Leviticus, and more particularly on Deuteronomy,
but there are also occasional non-biblical regulations. The beginning of
the manuscript is badly mutilated. Column I is missing. Columns III-XII
are so fragmented that only a very hypothetical reconstruction,
exclusively from biblical texts, is possible (cf. most extensively E.
Qimron, The Temple Scroll, 1996). I have decided not to translate
them but indicate their probable contents in the summary that follows:
1. Covenant between God and Israel (II).
2. Building of the Temple, measurements of the Sanctuary, the
Holy of Holies, the chambers and colonnades (III-VII).
3. Description of the mercy seat, the cherubim, the veil, the table,
the golden lamp-stand, etc. (VII-XI).
4. Outline of the sacrificesand the altar (XI-XII).
5. Daily, weekly and monthly sacrifices and those offered on
festivals (XIII-XXIX).
6. Buildings in the Temple courtyards: the stairhouse, the house of


---

the laver, the house for sacred vessels, the slaughterhouse, etc.
(xxx-xxxv).
7. The three courtyards of the Temple, one for the priests, one for
Jewish men over twenty years of age, and one for women and
children (XXXVI-XLV).
8. Purity regulations concerning the Temple and the city of the
Sanctuary (XLVI-XLVIII).
9. Purity regulations concerning the cities of Israel (XLVIII-LI).
10. Judges and officers (LI).
11. Laws relating to idolatry and to sacrificial animals (LI-LIII).
12. Vows and oaths (LIII-LIV).
13. Laws against apostasy (LIV-LV).
14. Laws relating to priests and Levites and detailed statutes of
the Jewish king (LVI-LIX).
15. Miscellaneous laws regarding priestly dues, idols, witnesses,
the conduct of war, the rebellious son, crimes punishable by
‘hanging’, and incestuous relations (LX-LXVI).
The sequence of subjects generally follows the Bible, but an obvious
effort has been made to systematize, harmonize and reinterpret the
laws. Sections complementary to Scripture include the Temple
legislation (III-XII, XXX-XLV), festivals (XVII-XXIX), purity material as
rules relating to the Temple and the city (XLVI-XLVII), and the statutes
of the king (LVI—LIX). The aim of the redactor is to present the
message of the scroll not as an interpretation of the Bible, but as an
immediate divine revelation. For this purpose, not only does he
formulate the supplementary legislation as directly spoken by God, but
also frequently substitutes ‘I’ for ’the Lord = YHWH’ of Scripture.
Although the view has been advanced that the Temple Scroll is not a
Qumran composition, the contrary thesis has a solid foundation. The
relationship between this writing and the Damascus Document is
particularly striking in the case of the prohibition of royal polygamy, of
marriage between uncle and niece, and of marital relations within the
city of the Sanctuary (compare CD IV, 20-V, II; XII, 1-2 with TS LVII, 16-
18; LXVI, 15-17; XLV, 11-12), to name the most significant instances.
Note also that the death penalty of ‘hanging’ (probably crucifixion)
reserved for traitors appears both in TS LXIV, 6-13 and in the Nahum

Commentary (cf. p. 504). Since the Damascus Document and the
Nahum Commentary are more likely to depend on the Temple Scroll
than vice versa, the latter may safely be dated to the second century
BCE. But it may also have an antecedent history reaching back to the
pre-Qumran age.
As noted, Cave 4 has also yielded five fairly mutilated fragments
(4Q365a), palaeographically dated to the mid-first century BCE, some
of which have been used by Yadin. Fragment 1 deals with the festival
of Unleavened Bread (11QTS XVII, II); fragment 2 corresponds to
11QTS XXXVIII, 4-15 while the other three fragments cannot be placed
within the known version of the text.
The composition is available in a magisterial edition by Yigael
Yadin, who first published it in Hebrew in 1977 and subsequently,
shortly before his death, in English under the title The Temple Scroll I-
III (Jerusalem, 1983). My translation is often indebted to Yadin’s
editorial work. Further improvements are due to E. Qimron, The
Temple Scroll: A Critical Edition with Extensive Reconstructions
(Beer-Sheva/Jerusalem, 1996). For 11Q20-21, see F. García Martínez
et al., DJD, XXIII, 357-414. For 4Q365a, see S. White, DJD, XIII, 319-
33. For 4Q524, see E. Puech, DJD, XXV, 79-114.
II [Behold, I will make a covenant.]
[For it is something dreadful that I] will do [to you.] [I myself will expel
from before you] the A[morites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the
Girgashit]es, the Pe[rizzites, the Hivites and] the Jebusites. Ta[ke care
not to make a cove]nant with the inhabitants of the country [which you
are to] enter so that they may not prove a sn[are for you.] You must
destroy their [alta]rs, [smash their] pillars [and] cut down their [sacred
trees and burn] [their] idols [with fire]. You must not desire silver and
gold so [that you may not be ensnared by them; for that would be
abominable to me]. You must [not] br[ing any abominable idol] into your
house [and come] under the ban together with it. You shall de[test and
abominate it], for it is under the ban. You shall not worship [another]
go[d, for YHWH, whose name is] [Jealous], is a jealous God. Take
care not to make a [covenant with the inhabitants of the country] [so
that, when they whore] after [their go]ds [and] sacrifice to [them and

XIII [This is what you shall offer on the altar:] t[wo y]ear[ling lambs]
without blemish [every day as a perpetual holocaust. You shall offer the
first in the morning; and you shall offer the other lamb in the evening;
the corresponding grain-offering will be a te]nth of fine flour mixed with
[a quarter of a hin of beaten oil; it shall be a perpetual holocaust of
soothing odour, an offering by fire] to YHWH; and the corresponding
drink-offering shall be a quart[er of a hin of] wine. [The priest who
offers the holocaust shall receive the skin of] the burnt-[offering which
he has offered. You shall offer the other lamb in the even]ing with the
same grain-[offering as in the] morning and with the corresponding
drink-offering as an offering by fire, a soothing odour to YHWH ...
On the S[abbath] days you shall offer two [yearling rams without
blemish and two] XIV [tenths of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with oil,
for a grain-offering and the corresponding drink-offering. This is the
holocaust of every Sabbath in addition to the perpetual holocaust and
the corresponding drink-offering. On the first day of each month you
shall offer a holocaust to YHWH: two young bulls, one ram, seven
yearling rams without blemish and a grain-offe]ring of fine flour, [three

drink-offering, one third of a hinfor each ram;] ... one tenth [of fine flour
for] a grain-[offering, mixed with a quarter of a hin, and wine, a quarter
of a hi]n for each lamb ... a soothing [odour] to YHWH on the first day
of each month. This is the burnt-offering for each month for the months
of the year ... On the first day of the [first] month [the months (of the
year) shall start; it shall be the first month] of the year [for you. You shall
do no] work. [You shall offer a he-goat for a sin-offering.] It shall be
offered by itself to expiate [for you. You shall offer a holocaust: a
bullock], a ram, [seven yearli]ng ram lambs [without blemish] ...

and a he-[goat] ... according to this statute. For the ordination (of the
priests), one ram for each [day, and] baskets of bread for all the ra[ms
of the ordination, one basket for] each [ram]. They shall divide all the
rams and the baskets for the seve[n days of the ordination for each]
day; according to [their] division[s, they shall offer to YHWH the right
thigh] of the ram as a holocaust and [the fat covering the entrails and
the] two kidneys and the fat on them [and on] the loins and the whole fat
tail close to the backbone and the appendage of the liver and the
corresponding grain-offering and drink-offering according to the
sta[tute. They shall take one unleavened cake from the] basket and
one cake of bread with oil and [one] wafer, [and they shall put it all on
the fat] together with the offering of the right thigh. Those who sacrifice
shall wave the rams and the baskets of bread as a wa[ve-offering
be]fore YHWH. This is a holocaust, an offering by fire, of soothing
odour before YHWH. [They shall burn everything on the altar over] the
holocaust, to complete their ordination during the seven days of
[ordination].
If the High Priest is to [minister to YHWH, whoever] has been
ordained to put on the vestments in place of his father, shall offer [a bull
fo]r all the people and another for the priests. He shall offer the one for
the priests first. The elders of the priest[s] shall lay [their hands] XVI
[on] its [hea]d and after them the High Priest and all the [priests. They
shall slaughter] the bull [before YHWH]. The elders of the priests shall
take from the blood of the bull and [place] it [with their finger on the
horns of the altar] and they shall pour [the blood] around the four
corners of the [altar] ledge ... [and they shall take from its blood and

the corresponding grain-offering and drink-[offering according to their
statute,] he shall bur[n them on the altar.] It shall be [a burnt-]offering, an
offering by fire, of soothing odour be[fore YHWH. The flesh of the bull],
its skin and offal, they shall burn outside the [sanctuary city on a wood
fire] in a place reserved for sin-offerings. There they shall bur[n it with
its head and legs] together with all its entrails. They shall burn all of it
there except the fat. It is a sin-[offering]. He shall take the second bull,
which is for the people, and by it he shall expiate [for all the people of]
the assembly, by its blood and fat. As he did with the fir[st] bull, [so he
shall do] with the bull of the assembly. He shall place with his finger

blood, he shall sprinkle o[n the f]our corners of the altar ledge, and [its
fat and] the corresponding [grain-] offering and drink-offering, he shall
burn on the altar. It is a sin-offering for the assembly. XVII ... They shall
rejoice because expiation has been made for them ... This day [shall]
be a holy gathering for them, [an eternal rule for all their generations]

days a holocaust to YHWH: two young bulls, a ram, and seven ram
lambs without blemish and a he-goat for a sin-offering and the
corresponding grain-offering and drink-offering [according to the

portion], and burn it on the altar. They shall eat the remainder in the
[in]n[er] courtyard. The priests shall e[a]t it unleavened. It shall not be
eaten with leaven. It shall be ea[ten] on that day [before] sun[se]t. They

fail.
They shall offer to YHWH an offering from the rams and the lambs,

young bull, and to every ram and to [every lamb] and its limbs (?) shall
remain apart. The corresponding [grain-offering] and drink-offering
shall be on it, an [eternal] rule for your generations before YHWH.
After this holocaust he shall offer the holocaust of the tribe of Judah
separately. As he has done with the holocaust of the Levites, so shall
he do with the holocaust of the children of Judah after the Levites. On
the second day he shall first offer the holocaust of Benjamin and after it
he shall offer the holocaust of the children of Joseph, Ephraim and
Manasseh together. On the third day, he shall offer the holocaust of
Reuben separately, and the holocaust of Simeon separately. On the
fourth day he shall offer the holocaust of Issachar separately and the
holocaust of Zebulun separately. On the fifth day he shall offer the
holocaust of Gad separately and the holocaust of Asher separately. On
the sixth day XXV [he shall offer the holocaust of Dan separately and

In the [seventh] m[onth, on the first day of the month, you shall have] a

day, an eternal rule for your generation[s wherever you dwell.] You shall
rejoice on this day. On it you shall do no work. A sacred rest shall this
day be for you.
The tenth of this month is the Day of Atonement. You shall mortify
yourselves. For any person who does not mortify himself on this
selfsame day shall be cut off from his people. You shall offer on it a
holocaust to YHWH: one young bull, one ram, seven ram lambs, one

done with the blood of] his young bull and shall expiate with it for all the
people of the assembly. He shall send up in smoke its fat and the
corresponding grain-and drink-offering on the altar of the holocaust. Its
flesh, skin and dung they shall burn beside his young bull. It is a sin-
offering for the whole assembly. He shall expiate with it for all the
people of the assembly and it shall be forgiven to them. He shall wash
his hands and feet of the blood of the sin-offering and shall come to the
living goat and shall confess over its head the iniquities of the children
of Israel together with all their guilt, all their sins. He shall put them on
the head of the goat and despatch it to Azazel in the desert by the
hand of the man who is waiting ready. The goat shall bear all the
iniquities of (the children of Israel). XXVII ... [and he shall expiate] for all
the children of Israel and it shall be forgiven to them ... Afterwards he
shall offer the young bull, the r[a]m, and [the lambs, according to] the
[sta]tute relating to them, on the altar of the holocaust, and the
[ho]locaust will be accepted for the children of Israel, an eternal rule for
their generations. Once a year this day shall be for them a memorial.
They shall do no work on it, for it shall be [to] them a Sabbath of sacred
rest. Whoever shall do work on it or shall not mortify himself on it, shall
be cut off from the midst of his people. A Sabbath of sacred rest, a
holy gathering shall this day be for you. You shall sanctify it as a
memorial wherever you dwell and you shall do no work.

whole building and rafters shall be like (those of) the house of the laver.
It shall have two gates on the north and the south, one opposite the
other, according to the measurement of the gates of the house of the
laver. Inside all the walls of this house shall have apertures, their width
(and depth) two cubits each and their height four (?) with which the
entrails and the feet are raised to the altar. When they have completed
the sending up in smoke XXXIV ... They close the wheels and ... and
tie the horns of the young bulls to the rings and ... by the rings.
Afterwards they shall slaughter them and collect [the blood] in bowls
and toss it around the altar base. They shall open the wheels and strip
the skin of the young bulls from their flesh and cut them up into pieces,
salt the pieces, wash the entrails and the legs, salt them and send
them up in smoke on the fire which is on the altar, each young bull with
its pieces beside it and the corresponding grain-offering of fine flour
on it, the wine of the drink-offering beside it and some of it on it. The
priests, the sons of Aaron, shall send everything up in smoke on the
altar, an offering by fire, of soothing odour before YHWH. You shall
make chains hanging from the rafters of the twelve columns XXXV ...
whoever is not a priest shall die, and whoever ... [a prie]st who shall
come ... and he is not clothed in the [holy] vest[ments in which] he was
ordained, they too shall be put to death and shall not pro[fane the
san]ctuary of their God, thus incurring the iniquity of mortal guilt. You
shall sanctify the environs of the altar, the Temple, the laver and the

colonnade and they shall be most holy for ever and ever.
You shall make a place west of the Temple, a colonnade of pillars
standing around for the sin-offerings and the guilt-offerings, divided
from one another, the sin-offerings of the priests, the he-goats, and the
sin-offerings of the people and their guilt-offerings. None of these shall
be mingled one with another, for their places shall be divided from one
another in order that the priests may not err concerning all the sin-
offerings of the people, and all the rams (?) of the guilt-offerings, (thus)
incurring the sin of guilt.
The birds for the altar: he shall prepare turtledoves XXXVI ... from
the corner of ... [to the corne]r of the gat[e, one hundred and twenty
cubits.] The gate (shall be) forty [cubits] wide. Each side shall be

(The gate shall be) roofed with a panelling of cedar wood overlaid with
pure gold. Its doors shall be overlaid with fine gold.
From the corner of the gate to the second angle of the courtyard,
(there shall be) one hundred and twenty cubits. Thus shall be the
measurement of all these gates of the inner courtyard. The gates shall
lead inside into the courtyard. XXXVII You shall make [in]side the
court[yard] seats for the priests, and tables in front of the seats, in the
inner colonnade by the outer wall of the courtyard, places made for the
priests and their sacrifices, for the firstfruits and the tithes, for their
peace-offering sacrifices which they shall sacrifice. The sacrifices of
the peace-offerings of the children of Israel shall not be mingled with
the sacrifices of the priests.
In the four corners of the courtyard you shall make for them a place
for cooking-stoves where they shall seethe their sacrifices [and] sin-
offerings. XXXVIII ... There they shall eat ... the bird, the turtle-dove and
the young pigeons ...
You shall make a second [co]urtyard aro[u]nd [the in]ner [courtyard],

the south, to the west and to the north. Its wall shall be [fo]ur cubits wide
and twenty-eight cubits high. Chambers shall be made in the wall
outside and between each chamber there shall be three-[and-a-half
cubits] XXXIX ... that all the congregation of the children of Israel may
bow down before me ... No woman shall come there, nor a child until
the day that he has fulfilled the rule ... [and has paid for] himself [a
ransom] to YHWH, half a shekel, an eternal rule, a memorial wherever
they dwell. The shekel (consists of) twenty gerahs.
When they shall collect from him the half-shekel... to me. Afterwards
they shall enter from the age of twenty ... The na[mes of the g]ates of
this [co]urtyard sha[ll b]e according to the nam[es of] the children of
Is[ra]el: Simeon, Levi and Judah in the east; Reuben, Joseph and
Benjamin in the south; Issachar, Zebulun and Gad in the west; Dan,
Naphtali and Asher in the north. Between each gate the measurement

nine cubits, and the gate twenty-eight cubits. From this gate of Simeon
to the gate of Levi, ninety-nine cubits, and the gate, twenty-eight cubits.
From the gate of Levi to the gate of Judah XL ... You shall make a third
courtyard ... to their daughters and to the strangers who [were] born ...

of Dan to the gate of Naphtali, three hundred and sixty cubits. From the
gate of Naphtali to the gate of Asher, three hundred and sixty cubits.
From the gate of Asher to the eastern corner, three hundred and sixty
cubits. The gates shall jut outwards from the wall of the courtyard seven
cubits, and extend inwards from the wall to the courtyard thirty-six
cubits. The entrance of the gate shall be fourteen cubits wide and
twenty-eight cubits high up to the lintel. The rafters at the doorways (?)
shall be of cedar wood and overlaid with gold. The doors shall be
overlaid with pure gold. Between each gate inwards you shall make
storehouses, XLII [rooms and colonnades.]
The room shall be ten cubits wide, twenty cubits long, and four[teen]
cubits high ... with cedar wood. The wall shall be two cubits wide. On
the outside there shall be storehouses. [The storehouse shall be ten
cubits wide and] twenty cubits [long]. The wall shall be two cubits wide

[corresponding] rooms. The colon[nade] ... shall be ten cubits [wi]de.
Between each gate [you shall make eight]een storehouses and the
corresponding eight[een] rooms ...
You shall make a staircase next to the walls of the gates towards the
colonnade. Winding stairs shall go up to the second and third
colonnades and to the roof. You shall build storehouses and
corresponding rooms and colonnades as on the ground floor. The
second and the third (levels) shall follow the measurement of the lower
one. On the roof of the third you shall make pillars roofed with rafters
from one pillar to the next (providing) a place for tabernacles. The
(pillars) shall be eight cubits high and the tabernacles shall be made
on their (roof) each year at the feast of the Tabernacles for the elders

the children of Israel, the captains of the thousands, the captains of the
hundreds, who will ascend and dwell there until the sacrificing of the
holocaust on the festival which is the feast of the Tabernacles, each
year. Between each gate there shall be XLIII ... on the days of the
firstfruits of the corn, of the w[ine (tirosh) and the oil, and at the festival
of the offering of] wood. On these days (the tithe) shall be eaten. They


---

## Page 249

shall not put aside anything from it from one year to another. For they
shall eat it in this manner. From the feast of the Firstfruits of the corn of
wheat they shall eat the corn until the next year, until the feast of the
Firstfruits, and (they shall drink) the wine from the day of the festival of
Wine until the next year, until the day of the festival of the Wine, and
(they shall eat) the oil from its festival, until the next year, until the
festival, the day of offering the new oil on the altar. Whatever is left (to
last beyond) their festivals shall be sanctified by being burnt with fire. It
shall no longer be eaten for it is holy. Those who live within a distance
of three days’ walk from the sanctuary shall bring whatever they can
bring. If they cannot carry it, they shall sell it for money and buy with it
corn, wine, oil, cattle and sheep, and shall eat them on the days of the
festivals. On working days they shall not eat from this in their weariness
for it is holy. On the holy days it shall be eaten, but it shall not be eaten
on working days. XLIV ...
You shall allot [the rooms and the corresponding chambers. From
the gate of Simeo]n to the gate of Judah shall be for the priests ... All
that is to the right and to the left of the gate of Levi, you shall allo[t] to
Aaron, your brother, one hundred and eight rooms and corresponding
chambers and two tabernacles which are on the roof. (You shall allot)
to the sons of Judah (the area) from the gate of Judah to the corner:
fifty-four rooms and corresponding chambers and the tabernacle that
is over them. (You shall allot) to the sons of Simeon (the area) from the
gate of Simeon to the second corner: their rooms, the corresponding
chambers and tabernacles. (You shall allot) to the sons of Reuben (the
area) from the corner which is beside the sons of Judah to the gate of
Reuben: fifty-two rooms and the corresponding chambers and
tabernacles. (The area) from the gate of Reuben to the gate of Joseph
(you shall allot) to the sons of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh. (The
area) from the gate of Joseph to the gate of Benjamin (you shall allot)
to the sons of Kohath from the Levites. (The area) from the gate of
Benjamin to the western corner (you shall allot) to the sons of
Benjamin. (The area) from this corner to the gate of Issachar (you shall
allot) to the sons of Issachar. (The area) from the gate (of Issachar)
XLV... the second (= incoming) [priestly course] shall enter on the left
... and the first (= outgoing) shall leave on the right. They shall not

## Page 250

mingle with one another nor their vessels. [Each] priestly course shall
come to its place and they shall stay there. One shall arrive and the
other leave on the eighth day. They shall clean the rooms, one after the
other, when the first (priestly course) leaves. There shall be no mingling
there.
No man who has had a nocturnal emission shall enter the sanctuary
at all until three days have elapsed. He shall wash his garments and
bathe on the first day and on the third day he shall wash his garments
and bathe, and after sunset he shall enter the sanctuary. They shall not
enter my sanctuary in their impure uncleanness and render it unclean.
No man who has had sexual intercourse with his wife shall enter
anywhere into the city of the sanctuary where I cause my name to
abide, for three days. No blind man shall enter it in all his days and
shall not profane the city where I abide, for I, YHWH, abide amongst
the children of Israel for ever and ever.
Whoever is to purify himself of his flux shall count seven days for his
purification. He shall wash his garments on the seventh day and bathe
his whole body in running water. Afterwards he shall enter the city of
the sanctuary. No one unclean through contact with a corpse shall enter
there until he has purified himself. No leper nor any man smitten (in his
body) shall enter there until he has purified himself and has offered ...
XLVI ... [No] unclean bird shall fly over [my] sanctua[ry] ... the roofs of
the gates ... the outer courtyard ... be in my sanctuary for ever and ever
all the time that I [abide] among them.
You shall make a terrace round about, outside the outer courtyard,
fourteen cubits wide like the entrances of all the gates. You shall make
twelve steps (leading) to it by which the children of Israel shall ascend
there to enter my sanctuary.
You shall make a one-hundred-cubits-wide ditch around the
sanctuary which shall divide the holy sanctuary from the city so that no
one can rush into my sanctuary and defile it. They shall sanctify my
sanctuary and hold it in awe because I abide among them.
You shall make for them latrines outside the city where they shall go
out, north-west of the city. These shall be roofed houses with holes in
them into which the filth shall go down. It shall be far enough not to be
visible from the city, (at) three thousand cubits.

## Page 251

You shall make three areas to the east of the city, divided from one
another, where the lepers, those suffering from a flux and men who
have had a (nocturnal) emission XLVII ...
Their cities [shall be] pure ... for ever. The city which I will sanctify,
causing my name and [my] sanctuar[y] to abide [in it], shall be holy and
pure of all impurity with which they can become impure. Whatever is in
it shall be pure. Whatever enters it shall be pure: wine, oil, all food and
all moistened (food) shall be clean. No skin of clean animals
slaughtered in their cities shall be brought there (to the city of the
sanctuary). But in their cities they may use them for any work they
need. But they shall not bring them to the city of my sanctuary, for the
purity of the skin corresponds to that of the flesh. You shall not profane
the city where I cause my name and my sanctuary to abide. For it is in
the skins (of animals) slaughtered in the sanctuary that they shall bring
their wine and oil and all their food to the city of my sanctuary. They
shall not pollute my sanctuary with the skins of animals slaughtered in
their country which are tainted (= unfit for the Temple). You cannot
render any city among your cities as pure as my city, for the purity of
the skin of the animal corresponds to the purity of its flesh. If you
slaughter it in my sanctuary, it shall be pure for my sanctuary, but if you
slaughter it in your cities, it shall be pure (only) for your cities. Whatever
is pure for the sanctuary, shall be brought in skins (fit) for the sanctuary,
and you shall not profane my sanctuary and my city where I abide with
tainted skins.
XLVIII ... [the cormorant, the stork, every ki]nd of [heron,] the
hoop[oe and the bat] ...
You may eat [the following] flying [insects]: every kind of great locust,
every kind of long-headed locust, every kind of green locust, and every
kind of desert locust. These are among the flying insects which you
may eat: those which walk on four legs and have legs jointed above
their feet to leap with them on the ground and wings to fly with. You
shall not eat the carcass of any bird or beast but may sell it to a
foreigner. You shall not eat any abominable thing, for you are a holy
people to YHWH, your God.
You are the sons of YHWH, your God. You shall not gash yourselves
or shave your forelocks in mourning for the dead, nor shall you tattoo


---

## Page 252

yourselves, for you are a holy people to YHWH, your God. You shall not
profane your land.
You shall not do as the nations do; they bury their dead everywhere,
they bury them even in their houses. Rather you shall set apart areas in
the midst of your land where you shall bury your dead. Between four
cities you shall designate an area for burial. In every city you shall set
aside areas for those stricken with leprosy, with plague and with scab,
who shall not enter your cities and profane them, and also for those
who suffer from a flux; and for menstruating women, and women after
childbirth, so that they may not cause defilement in their midst by their
impure uncleanness. The leper suffering from chronic leprosy or scab,
who has been pronounced unclean by the priest XLIX ... with cedar
wood, hyssop and ... your cities with the plague of leprosy and they
shall be unclean.
If a man dies in your cities, the house in which the dead man has
died shall be unclean for seven days. Whatever is in the house and
whoever enters the house shall be unclean for seven days. Any food on
which water has been poured shall be unclean, anything moistened
shall be unclean. Earthenware vessels shall be unclean and whatever
they contain shall be unclean for every clean man. The open (vessels)
shall be unclean for every Israelite (with) whatever is moistened in
them.
On the day when the body is removed from there, they shall cleanse
the house of all pollution of oil, wine and water moisture. They shall rub
its (the house’s) floor, walls and doors and shall wash with water the
bolts, doorposts, thresholds and lintels. On the day when the body is
removed from there, they shall purify the house and all its utensils,
hand-mills and mortars, all utensils of wood, iron and bronze and all
utensils capable of purification. Clothes, sacks and skins shall be
washed. As for the people, whoever has been in the house or has
entered the house shall bathe in water and shall wash his clothes on
the first day. On the third day they shall sprinkle purifying water on them
and shall bathe. They shall wash their garments and all the utensils in
the house.
On the seventh day they shall sprinkle (them) a second time. They
shall bathe, wash their clothes and utensils and shall be clean by the


---

## Page 253

evening of (the impurity contracted) from the dead so as to (be fit to)
touch their pure things. As for a man who has not been rendered
unclean on account of L ... they have been unclean. No longer ... until
they have sprinkled (them) the second [time] on the seventh day and
shall be clean by the evening at sunset.
Whoever touches the bone of a dead person in the fields, or one
slain by the sword, or a dead body or the blood of a dead person, or a
tomb, he shall purify himself according to the rule of this statute. But if
he does not purify himself according to the statute of this law, he is
unclean, his uncleanness being still in him. Whoever touches him must
wash his clothes, bathe and he shall be clean by the evening.
If a woman is with child and it dies in her womb, as long as it is dead
in her, she shall be unclean like a tomb. Any house that she enters shall
be unclean with all its utensils for seven days. Whoever touches it shall
be unclean till the evening. If anyone enters the house with her, he shall
be unclean for seven days. He shall wash his clothes and bathe in
water on the first (day). On the third day he shall sprinkle and wash his
clothes and bathe. On the seventh day he shall sprinkle a second time
and wash his clothes and bathe. At sunset he shall be clean.
As for all the utensils, clothes, skins and all the materials made of
goat’s hair, you shall deal with them according to the statute of this law.
All earthenware vessels shall be broken for they are unclean and can
no more be purified ever.
All creatures that teem on the ground you shall proclaim unclean: the
weasel, the mouse, every kind of lizard, the wall gecko, the sand
gecko, the great lizard and the chameleon. Whoever touches them
dead LI ... [and whatever com]es out of the[m] ... [shall be] unclean [to
you.] You shall [not] render yourselves unclean by th[em. Whoever
touches them] dead shall be unclean un[til the] evening. He shall wash
his clothes and bathe [in water and at] sun[set] he shall be clean.
Whoever carries any of their bones, their carcass, skin, flesh or claw
shall wash his clothes and bathe in water. After sunset he shall be
clean. You shall forewarn the children of Israel about all the impurities.
They shall not render themselves unclean by those of which I tell you
on this mountain and they shall not be unclean.
For I, YHWH, abide among the children of Israel. You shall sanctify


---

## Page 254

them and they shall be holy. They shall not render themselves
abominable by anything that I have separated for them as unclean and
they shall be holy.
You shall establish judges and officers in all your towns and they
shall judge the people with just judgement. They shall not be partial in
(their) judgement. They shall not accept bribes, nor shall they twist
judgement, for the bribe twists judgement, overturns the works of
justice, blinds the eyes of the wise, produces great guilt, and profanes
the house by the iniquity of sin. Justice and justice alone shall you
pursue that you may live and come to inherit the land that I give you to
inherit for all days. The man who accepts bribes and twists just
judgement shall be put to death. You shall not be afraid to execute him.
You shall not do in your land as the nations do. Everywhere they
sacrifice, plant sacred trees, erect sacred pillars and set up carved
stones to bow down before them and build for them LII ... You shall not
plant [any tree as a sacred tree beside my altar to be made by you.]
You shall not erect a sacred pillar [that is hateful to me.] You shall not
make anywhere in your land a carved stone to bow down before it. You
shall not sacrifice to me any cattle or sheep with a grave blemish, for
they are abominable to me. You shall not sacrifice to me any cattle or
sheep or goat that is pregnant, for this would be an abomination to me.
You shall not slaughter a cow or a ewe and its young on the same day,
neither shall you kill a mother with her young.
Of all the firstlings born to your cattle or sheep, you shall sanctify for
me the male animals. You shall not use the firstling of your cattle for
work, nor shall you shear the firstling of your small cattle. You shall eat it
before me every year in the place that I shall choose. Should it be
blemished, being lame or blind or (afflicted with) any grave blemish,
you shall not sacrifice it to me. It is within your towns that you shall eat
it. The unclean and the clean among you together (may eat it) like a
gazelle or a deer. It is the blood alone that you shall not eat. You shall
spill it on the ground like water and cover it with dust. You shall not
muzzle an ox while it is threshing. You shall not plough with an ox and
an ass (harnessed) together. You shall not slaughter clean cattle or
sheep or goat in any of your towns, within a distance of three days’
journey from my sanctuary. It is rather in my sanctuary that you shall


---

## Page 255

slaughter it, making of it a holocaust or peace-offering. You shall eat
and rejoice before me in the place on which I choose to set my name.
Every clean animal with a blemish, you shall eat it within your towns,
away from my sanctuary at a distance of thirty stadia. You shall not
slaughter it close to my sanctuary for its flesh is tainted. You shall not
eat in my city, which I sanctify by placing my name in it, the flesh of
cattle, sheep or goat which has not entered my sanctuary. They shall
sacrifice it there, toss its blood to the base of the altar of holocaust and
shall burn its fat. LIII [When I extend your frontiers as I have told you,
and if the place where I have chosen to set my name is too distan]t,
and you say, ‘I will eat meat’, because you [l]ong for it, [whatever you
desire,] you may eat, [and you may slau]gh[ter] any of your small cattle
or cattle which I give you according to my blessing. You may eat it
within your towns, the clean and the unclean together, like gazelle or
deer (meat). But you shall firmly abstain from eating the blood. You
shall spill it on the ground like water and cover it with dust. For the
blood is the life and you shall not eat the life with the flesh so that it may
be well with you and with your sons after you for ever. You shall do that
which is correct and good before me, for I am YHWH, your God.
But all your devoted gifts and votive donations you shall bring when
you come to the place where I cause my name to abide, and you shall
sacrifice (them) there before me as you have devoted and vowed them
with your mouth. When you make a vow, you shall not tarry in fulfilling it,
for surely I will require it of you and you shall become guilty of a sin. You
shall keep the word uttered by your lips, for your mouth has vowed
freely to perform your vow.
When a man makes a vow to me or swears an oath to take upon
himself a binding obligation, he must not break his word. Whatever has
been uttered by his mouth, he shall do it.
When a woman makes a vow to me, or takes upon herself a binding
obligation by means of an oath in her father’s house, in her youth, if her
father hears of her vow or the binding obligation which she has taken
upon herself and remains silent, all her vows shall stand, and her
binding obligation which she has taken upon herself shall stand. If,
however, her father definitely forbids her on the day that he hears of it,
none of her vows or binding obligations which she has taken upon


---

## Page 256

herself shall stand, and I will absolve her because (her father) has
forbidden her LIV [when he] h[eard of them. But if he annuls them after]
the da[y that he has] hea[rd of them, he shall bear] her guilt: [her] fa[ther
has annulled them. Any vow] or binding oath (made by a woman) [to
mortify herself,] her husband may confi[rm it] or annul it on the day that
he hears of it, and I will absolve her.
But any vow of a widow or a divorced woman, whatever she has
taken upon herself shall stand in conformity with all that her mouth has
uttered.
Everything that I command you today, see to it that it is kept. You
shall not add to it, nor detract from it.
If a prophet or a dreamer appears among you and presents you with
a sign or a portent, even if the sign or the portent comes true, when he
says, ‘Let us go and worship other gods whom you have not known!’,
do not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer, for I am
testing you to discover whether you love YHWH, the God of your
fathers, with all your heart and soul. It is YHWH, your God, that you must
follow and serve, and it is him that you must fear and his voice that you
must obey, and you must hold fast to him. That prophet or dreamer
shall be put to death for he has preached rebellion against YHWH, your
God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from
the house of bondage, to lead you astray from the path that I have
commanded you to follow. You shall rid yourself of this evil.
If your brother, the son of your father or the son of your mother, or
your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend
who is like your own self, (seeks to) entice you secretly, saying, ‘Let us
go and worship other gods whom you have not known’, neither you, LV
[nor] your [fa]thers, some of the gods [of the peoples that are round
about you, whether near you or far off from you], from the one end of
the earth to [the other, you shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor
shall your eye pity] him, nor shall you spare [him, nor shall you conceal
him; but you shall kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him
to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. You shall stone him
to death with stones because he sought to] draw you away [from me
who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and never again do such an evil

thing] among you. If in on[e of your cities in which I] give you to dw[ell]
you hear this said: ‘Men, [s]ons of [Beli]al have arisen in your midst and
have led astray all the inhabitants of their city saying, “Let us go and
worship gods whom you have not known!”,’ you shall inquire, search
and investigate carefully. If the matter is proven true that such an
abomination has been done in Israel, you shall surely put all the
inhabitants of that city to the sword. You shall place it and all who are in
it under the ban, and you shall put the beasts to the sword. You shall
assemble all the booty in (the city) square and shall burn it with fire, the
city and all the booty, as a whole-offering to YHWH, your God. It shall
be a ruin for ever and shall never be rebuilt. Nothing from that which
has been placed under the ban shall cleave to your hand so that I may
turn from my hot anger and show you compassion. I will be
compassionate to you and multiply you as I told your fathers, provided
that you obey my voice, keeping all my commandments that I
command you today, to do that which is correct and good before
YHWH, your God.
If among you, in one of your towns that I give you, there is found a
man or a woman who does that which is wrong in my eyes by
transgressing my covenant, and goes and worships other gods, and
bows down before them, or before the sun or the moon, or all the host
of heaven, if you are told about it, and you hear about this matter, you
shall search and investigate it carefully. If the matter is proven true that
such an abomination has been done in Israel, you shall lead out that
man or that woman and stone him (to death) with stones.
LVI... [You shall go to the Levitical priests o]r to the [j]u[dges then in
office]; you shall seek their guidance and [they] shall pro[nounce on] the
matter for which [you have sought their guidance, and they shall
procl]aim the(ir) judgement to you. You shall act in conformity with the
law that they proclaim to you and the saying that they declare to you
from the book of the Law. They shall issue to you a proclamation in
truth from the place where I choose to cause my name to abide. Be
careful to do all that they teach you and act in conformity with the
decision that they communicate to you. Do not stray from the law which
they proclaim to you to the right or to the left. The man who does not
listen but acts arrogantly without obeying the priest who is posted there

to minister before me, or the judge, that man shall die. You shall rid
Israel of evil. All the people shall hear of it and shall be awe-stricken,
and none shall ever again be arrogant in Israel.
When you enter the land which I give you, take possession of it,
dwell in it and say, ‘I will appoint a king over me as do all the nations
around me!’, you may surely appoint over you the king whom I will
choose. It is from among your brothers that you shall appoint a king
over you. You shall not appoint over you a foreigner who is not your
brother. He (the king) shall definitely not acquire many horses, neither
shall he lead the people back to Egypt for war to acquire many horses
and much silver and gold, for I told you, ‘You shall never again go back
that way’. He shall not acquire many wives that they may not turn his
heart away from me. He shall not acquire very much silver and gold.
When he sits on the throne of his kingdom, they shall write for him
this law from the book which is before the priests. LVII This is the law
[that they shall write for him] ... [They shall count,] on the day that they
appoint hi[m] king, the sons of Israel from the age of twenty to sixty
years according to their standard (units). He shall install at their head
captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties and
captains of tens in all their cities. He shall select from among them one
thousand by tribe to be with him: twelve thousand warriors who shall
not leave him alone to be captured by the nations. All the selected men
whom he has selected shall be men of truth, God-fearers, haters of
unjust gain and mighty warriors. They shall be with him always, day and
night. They shall guard him from anything sinful, and from any foreign
nation in order not to be captured by them. The twelve princes of his
people shall be with him, and twelve from among the priests, and from
among the Levites twelve. They shall sit together with him to (proclaim)
judgement and the law so that his heart shall not be lifted above them,
and he shall do nothing without them concerning any affair.
He shall not marry as wife any daughter of the nations, but shall take
a wife for himself from his father’s house, from his father’s family. He
shall not take another wife in addition to her, for she alone shall be with
him all the time of her life. But if she dies, he may marry another from
his father’s house, from his family. He shall not twist judgement; he
shall take no bribe to twist a just judgement and shall not covet a field

or a vineyard, any riches or house, or anything desirable in Israel. He
shall (not) rob LVIII ...
When the king hears of any nation or people intent on plundering
whatever belongs to Israel, he shall send for the captains of thousands
and the captains of hundreds posted in the cities of Israel. They shall
send with him (the captain) one tenth of the people to go with him (the
king) to war against their enemies, and they shall go with him. But if a
large force enters the land of Israel, they shall send with him one fifth of
the warriors. If a king with chariots and horses and a large force
(comes), they shall send with him one third of the warriors, and the two
(remaining) divisions shall guard their city and their boundaries so that
no marauders invade their land. If the war presses him (the king) hard,
they shall send to him half of the people, the men of the army, but the
(other) half of the people shall not be severed from their cities.
If they triumph over their enemies, smash them, put them to the
sword and carry away their booty, they shall give the king his tithe of
this, the priests one thousandth and the Levites one hundredth from
everything. They shall halve the rest between the combatants and their
brothers whom they have left in their cities.
If he (the king) goes to war against his enemies, one fifth of the
people shall go with him, the warriors, all the mighty men of valour.
They shall avoid everything unclean, everything shameful, every iniquity
and guilt. He shall not go until he has presented himself before the
High Priest who shall inquire on his behalf for a decision by the Urim
and Tummim. It is at his word that he shall go and at his word that he
shall come, he and all the children of Israel who are with him. He shall
not go following his heart’s counsel until he (the High Priest) has
inquired for a decision by the Urim and Tummim. He shall (then)
succeed in all his ways on which he has set out according to the
decision which LIX ... and they shall disperse them in many lands and
they shall become a h[orror], a byword, a mockery. With a heavy yoke
and in extreme want, they shall there serve gods made by human
hands, of wood and stone, silver and gold. During this time their cities
shall become a devastation, a laughing-stock and a wasteland, and
their enemies shall devastate them. They shall sigh in the lands of their
enemies and scream because of the heavy yoke. They shall cry out but


---

## Page 260

I will not listen; they shall scream but I will not answer them because of
their evil doings. I will hide my face from them and they shall become
food, plunder and prey. None shall save them because of their
wickedness, because they have broken my covenant and their soul
has loathed my law until they have incurred every guilt. Afterwards they
will return to me with all their heart and all their soul, in conformity with
all the words of this law, and I will save them from the hand of their
enemies and redeem them from the hand of those who hate them, and
I will bring them to the land of their fathers. I will redeem them, and
increase them and exult over them. I will be their God and they shall be
my people.
The king whose heart and eyes have gone astray from my
commandments shall never have one to sit on the throne of his fathers,
for I will cut off his posterity for ever so that it shall no more rule over
Israel. But if he walk after my rules and keep my commandments and
do that which is correct and good before me, no heir to the throne of
the kingdom of Israel shall be cut off from among his sons for ever. I will
be with him and will save him from the hand of those who hate him and
from the hand of those who seek his life. I will place all his enemies
before him and he shall rule over them according to his pleasure and
they shall not rule over him. I will set him on an upward, not on a
downward, course, to be the head and not the tail, that the days of his
kingdom may be lengthened greatly for him and his sons after him.
LX ... and all their wave-offerings. All their firstling male [bea]sts and
all ... of their beasts and all their holy gifts which they shall sanctify to
me together with all their holy gifts of praise and a proportion of their
offering of birds, wild animals and fish, one thousandth of their catch,
and all that they shall devote, and the proportion of the booty and the
plunder.
To the Levites shall belong the tithe of the corn, the wine and the oil
that they have sanctified to me first; the shoulder from those who
slaughter a sacrifice and a proportion of the booty, the plunder and the
catch of birds, wild animals and fish, one hundredth; the tithe from the
young pigeons and from the honey one fiftieth. To the priests shall
belong one hundredth of the young pigeons, for I have chosen them
from all your tribes to attend on me and minister (before me) and bless


---

## Page 261

my name, he and his sons always. If a Levite come from any town
anywhere in Israel where he sojourns to the place where I will choose
to cause my name to abide, (if he come) with an eager soul, he may
minister like his brethren the Levites who attend on me there. He shall
have the same share of food with them, besides the inheritance from
his father’s family.
When you enter the land which I give you, do not learn to practise the
abominations of those nations. There shall be found among you none
who makes his son or daughter pass through fire, nor an augur or a
soothsayer, a diviner or a sorcerer, one who casts spells or a medium,
or wizards or necromancers. For they are an abomination before me,
all who practise such things, and it is because of these abominations
that I drive them out before you. You shall be perfect towards YHWH,
your God. For these nations that LXI ... to ut[ter a word] in [my] n[ame
which I have n]ot comman[ded him to] utter, or wh[o speaks in the
name of oth]er go[ds], that prophet shall be put to death. If you say in
your heart, ‘How shall we know the word which YHWH has not
uttered?’, when the word uttered by the prophet in the name of YHWH
is not fulfilled and does not come true, that is not a word that I have
uttered. The prophet has spoken arrogantly; do not fear him.
A single witness may not come forward against a man in the matter
of any iniquity or sin which he has committed. It is on the evidence of
two witnesses or three witnesses that a case can be established. If a
malicious witness comes forward against a man to testify against him
in a case of a crime, both disputants shall stand before me and before
the priests and the Levites and before the judges then in office, and the
judges shall inquire, and if the witness is a false witness who has
testified falsely against his brother, you shall do to him as he proposed
to do to his brother. You shall rid yourselves of evil. The rest shall hear
of it and shall be awe-stricken and never again shall such a thing be
done in your midst. You shall have no mercy on him: life for life, eye for
eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
When you go to war against your enemies, and you see horses and
chariots and an army greater than yours, be not afraid of them, for I am
with you who brought you out of the land of Egypt. When you approach
the battle, the priest shall come forward to speak to the army and say


---

## Page 262

to them, ‘Hear, Israel, you approach ... ’ ... LXII [and another man shall
use its fruit. If any man has betrothed a woman but has not yet married
her, he shall return] home. Otherwise he may die in the war and
another man may take her. [The] of[ficers shall continue] to address the
army and say, ‘If any man is afraid and has lost heart, he shall go and
return. Otherwise he may render his kinsmen as faint-hearted as
himself.’
When the judges have finished addressing the army, they shall
appoint army captains at the head of the people.
When you approach a city to fight it, (first) offer it peace. If it seeks
peace and opens (its gates) to you, then all the people found in it shall
become your forced labourers and shall serve you. If it does not make
peace with you, but is ready to fight a war against you, you shall
besiege it and I will deliver it into your hands. You shall put all its males
to the sword, but the women, the children, the beasts and all that is in
the city, all its booty, you may take as spoil for yourselves. You may
enjoy the use of the booty of your enemies which I give you. Thus shall
you treat the very distant cities, those which are not among the cities of
these nations. But in the cities of the peoples which I give you as an
inheritance, you shall not leave alive any creature. Indeed you shall
utterly exterminate the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the
Hivites, the Jebusites, the Girgashites and the Perizzites as I have
commanded you, that they may not teach you to practise all the
abominations that they have performed to their gods.
LXIII ... [a heifer with which] he has not worked, which [has not drawn
the yoke. The elders of] that city [shall bring down] the heifer to a ravine
with an ever-flowing stream which has never been sown or cultivated,
and there they shall break its neck.
The priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for I have chosen
them to minister before me and bless my name, and every dispute and
every assault shall be decided by their word. All the elders of the city
nearest to the body of the murdered man shall wash their hands over
the head of the heifer whose neck has been broken in the ravine. They
shall declare, ‘Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see
it happen. Accept expiation for thy people Israel whom thou hast
redeemed, O YHWH, and do not permit the guilt of innocent blood to


---

## Page 263

rest among thy people, Israel. Let this blood be expiated for them.’ You
shall rid Israel (of the guilt) of innocent blood, and you shall do that
which is correct and good before YHWH, your God. When you go to
war against your enemies, and I deliver them into your hands, and you
capture some of them, if you see among the captives a pretty woman
and desire her, you may take her to be your wife. You shall bring her to
your house, you shall shave her head, and cut her nails. You shall
discard the clothes of her captivity and she shall dwell in your house,
and bewail her father and mother for a full month. Afterwards you may
go to her, consummate the marriage with her and she will be your wife.
But she shall not touch whatever is pure for you for seven years, neither
shall she eat of the sacrifice of peace-offering until seven years have
elapsed. Afterwards she may eat. LXIV ... [the firstfruits of his virility;
he has the right of the first-born.]
If a man has a disobedient and rebellious son who refuses to listen
to his father and mother, nor listens to them when they chastise him,
his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders
of his city, to the gate of his place. They shall say to the elders of his
town, ‘This son of ours is disobedient and rebellious; he does not listen
to us; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’ All the men of his city shall stone
him with stones and he shall die, and you shall rid yourselves of evil. All
the children of Israel shall hear of it and be awe-stricken. If a man
slanders his people and delivers his people to a foreign nation and
does evil to his people, you shall hang him on a tree and he shall die.
On the testimony of two witnesses and on the testimony of three
witnesses he shall be put to death and they shall hang him on the tree.
If a man is guilty of a capital crime and flees (abroad) to the nations,
and curses his people, the children of Israel, you shall hang him also on
the tree, and he shall die. But his body shall not stay overnight on the
tree. Indeed you shall bury him on the same day. For he who is hanged
on the tree is accursed of God and men. You shall not pollute the
ground which I give you to inherit. If you see your kinsman’s ox or
sheep or donkey straying, do not neglect them; you shall indeed return
them to your kinsman. If your kinsman does not live near you, and you
do not know who he is, you shall bring the animal to your house and it
shall be with you until he claims (it). LXV ...

## Page 264

[Wh]en a bird’s nest happens to lie before you by the roadside, on
any tree or on the ground, with fledglings or eggs, and the hen is sitting
on the fledglings or the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young.
You shall surely let the hen escape and take only the young so that it
may be well with you and your days shall be prolonged. When you build
a new house, you shall construct a parapet on the roof so that you do
not bring blood-guilt on your house if anyone should fall from it.
When a man takes a wife, has sexual intercourse with her and takes
a dislike to her, and brings a baseless charge against her, ruining her
reputation, and says, ‘I have taken this woman, approached her, and
did not find the proof of virginity in her’, the father or the mother of the
girl shall take the girl’s proof of virginity and bring it to the elders at the
gate. The girl’s father shall say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to be
this man’s wife; he has taken a dislike to her and has brought a
baseless charge against her saying, “I have not found the proof of
virginity in your daughter.” Here is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.’
They shall spread out the garment before the elders of that city. The
elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him. They shall fine
him one hundred pieces of silver which they shall give to the father of
the girl, because he (the husband) has tried to ruin the reputation of an
Israelite virgin. He shall not LXVI ... [When a virgin betrothed to a man
is found by another man in the city and he lies with her, they shall bring
both of them to the gate] of that city and stone them with stones and
they shall be put to death: the girl because she has not shouted (for
help, although she was) in the city, and the man because he has
dishonoured his neighbour’s wife. You shall rid yourselves of evil. If the
man has found the woman in the fields in a distant place hidden from
the city, and raped her, only he who has lain with her shall be put to
death. To the girl they shall do nothing since she has committed no
crime worthy of death. For this affair is like that of a man who attacks
his neighbour and murders him. For it was in the fields that he found
her and the betrothed girl shouted (for help), but none came to her
rescue.
When a man seduces a virgin who is not betrothed, but is suitable to
him according to the rule, and lies with her, and he is found out, he who
has lain with her shall give the girl’s father fifty pieces of silver and she

shall be his wife. Because he has dishonoured her, he may not divorce
her all his days. A man shall not take his father’s wife and shall not lift
his father’s skirt. A man shall not take the wife of his brother and shall
not lift the skirt of his brother, the son of his father or the son of his
mother, for this is unclean. A man shall not take his sister, the daughter
of his father or the daughter of his mother, for this is abominable. A
man shall not take his father’s sister or his mother’s sister, for this is
immoral. A man shall not take the daughter of his brother or the
daughter of his sister for this is abominable. (A man) shall not take

MMT (Miqsat Ma‘ase Ha- Torah) - Some
Observances of the Law
(4Q394-9)
Mutilated fragments of six Cave 4 manuscripts have acquired
international notoriety on account of a lawsuit filed before the
Jerusalem district court which found that one of the official editors of
this text, Elisha Qimron, owned the copyright of the MMT text as
reconstructed by him. Hershel Shanks, of the Biblical Archaeology
Society of Washington, was held responsible for breaching this
copyright and ordered to pay $43,000 damages. However, an appeal
having been lodged with the Israeli Supreme Court, the matter is still
subjudice.
When the contents of the six copies are assembled into a single
account, they amount to 120 lines mostly of a fragmentary nature. The
document begins with a sectarian calendar (section A), which may or
may not pertain to the original MMT; it continues with a series of
special rules (section B), and ends with an exhortation (section C).
MMT has been called an epistle, but since it lacks the introductory and
concluding formulae of a letter, it is more likely to be a kind of legal
tractate. It is addressed to a single leading personality who is
compared to King David. The dramatis personae consist of a ‘we’
party, a ‘you’ party, and a ‘they’ party. The group responsible for MMT,
who refer to themselves as ‘we‘, seek to detach the leader of the ‘you’
party from the erroneous views propounded by the ‘they’ party. The
editors claim that MMT was written by the Teacher of Righteousness
and sent to the Wicked Priest; that the views of the ‘we’ party are akin
to those of the Sadducees; and that the ‘they’ party are the Pharisees.
However, these are no more than hypotheses. In particular, the
identification of the author with the Teacher of Righteousness is less
likely than that of the leader of the ‘you’ group with the man who was to


---

## Page 267

become the Wicked Priest, probably Jonathan Maccabaeus.
It has also been advanced that the original nucleus of the Qumran
Community, responsible for MMT, consisted of early or proto-
Sadducees. However, one should bear in mind that the priests in this
writing are never called sons of Zadok or Sadducees, but are referred
to as sons of Aaron (cf. 4QSb (=4Q256) and 4QSd (4Q258) above, p.
118). The alleged Sadducee connection relies on three legal rules, out
of a list of more than twenty, in MMT which represent opinions identical
with the halakhah attributed in rabbinic literature to the Sadducees,
and contrasted with the stance taken by the Pharisees (cf. mParah 5:4
and MMT B 13-17; mYad 4:7; mToh 8:9 and MMT B 55-8; mYad 4:6
and MMT B 72-4).
The chief topics of controversy are (I) the calendar (if it is an integral
part of the document); (2) ritual purity (acceptability of Gentile offerings,
law on slaughter, the ‘red heifer’ ritual, exclusion of the blind and the
deaf, law relating to lepers, purity of running liquids, fourth-year fruit
and tithe of cattle, ban on dogs in Jerusalem, the law regulating contact
with dead bodies); (3) marriage and intermarriage rules, and (4)
decrees regulating entry into the congregation. MMT is particularly
important as a source of ancient legal debate. It is unique among the
Dead Sea Scrolls and foreshadows the halakhic process developed
and practised by later rabbis.
Instead of presenting a composite text, the translation will reflect
actual manuscripts and follow their line numbering. If there are
overlapping fragments, gaps in the main manuscript will be filled from
the parallel text and the borrowing will appear between {}. However, to
assist the reader who desires to consult the Qimron-Strugnell edition,
the line numbers of their composite text are given in brackets. Unlike
the editors, I have been economical with purely conjectural restorations
of the many gaps. Obscurities in the translation therefore faithfully
reflect the real status of the Hebrew original.
For the editio princeps, see E. Qimron and J. Strugnell, Qumran
Cave 4, V (DJD, X, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1994).

(4Q274)
This is the first of ten Cave 4 manuscripts dealing with purity matters.
The text translated represents column I of the document and the first
word of column II. 4Q274 deals with uncleanness caused by bodily
fluxes and issues of blood and with the means of its removal. Parts of
fr. 3 are concerned with the uncleanness associated with the juice
oozing out of fruit.

4QTohorot B -B
(40276-7)
These two fragments deal with the biblical law of the ‘red heifer’, the
ashes of which were used for the preparation of the ‘water for (the
removal of) uncleanness’ necessary for the cleansing of impurity
resulting from contact with a dead body. Relevant extracts from Num.
xix are freely quoted. The subject is treated also in MMT B 13 (4Q394
frs. 3-7 i, 16-20). The script dates to the late first century BCE.

Four fragments of a document have survived in a late Hasmonaean—

‘liquids of the Congregation’ links this fragment to IQS VI, 20, VII, 20.

The Master’s Exhortation to the Sons of Dawn
(40298)
Eight fragments of a manuscript which, apart from its title, is written in
a cryptic alphabet, contain an exhortation to a group, designated as
‘sons of dawn’ by the ‘Master’ (maskil), the title of the teacher in
charge of instruction in the Community (cf. Community Rule). The
phrase, ‘sons of dawn’ (bene ha-shahar) is possibly attested in the
Damascus Document XIII, 14 (cf. M. Broshi, The Damascus
Document Reconsidered, Jerusalem, 1992, [35]: ‘No member of the
Covenant shall have any dealings with the sons of dawn except for
payment’). The earlier reading was ‘sons of the Pit’ (bene ha-shahat).
S. Pfann suggests that ‘the sons of dawn’ (not yet ‘sons of light’) are
newcomers to the sect at the earliest stages of their initiation. The
exhortation recalls the opening pages of the Damascus Document.
The square script of the title is said to belong to the second half of the
first century BCE. Parts of frs. 1-2 and 3-4 are large enough to be
translated.
For the editio princeps, see Stephen Pfann and M. Kister, DJD, XX,

Register of Rebukes
(4Q477)
Fragments of two columns of a document contain a list of Community
members rebuked for offences against the rules. This is the only scroll
fragment which reveals the names of individual members: Yohanan
son of Ar[ ], Hananiah Notos and Hananiah son of Sim[on]. According
to the editor, Esther Eshel, the rebukes listed here were read out in
public by the mebaqqer (or Guardian), hence the title given by her, The
Rebukes Reported by the Overseer. To be more precise, it is likely
that the rebukes originated with witnesses of the offence. They
reported it to the Guardian who was to record the infringement (cf. CD
IX, 2-4; 16-20). The epithet Notos attached to the name of Hananiah
probably means ‘Southerner’ in line with a parallel Masada inscription
(no. 462: Shim’on bar Notos) according to Y. Yadin and J. Naveh,
Masada I (Jerusalem, 1989), 40. D. Flusser, as quoted by Eshel,
associates Notos with the Greek nothos (bastard). In col. II, 1. 8, Eshel,
following M. Broshi, reads shyr (=sh’r) bsrw (i.e. near kin); R. Eisenman
and M. Wise have shpk bsrw (emission of his body) and J. M.
Baumgarten (JJS 45 (1994), 277) swd bsrw (the carnal foundation of
man).
Frs. 1, 2 i and 3: the text is too fragmentary for translation. Note the
significant phrases ‘[to] recall their transgression’, ‘men of the
[Community?]’, ‘to rebuke’ and [‘c]amps of the Congregation’ and ‘they
rebuked’.

Remonstrances (before Conversion?)
(4Q471a)
This small fragment, written in Herodian script, contains reproofs
addressed in the second person plural to a group of wicked Jews. The
context is that of a war. It is unlikely to belong to the War Scroll or the
Book of War as neither of these includes speeches to outsiders.
According to a conjecture proposed by the editors, the opponents of
the sect thus criticized are the ruling class of Judaea (Hasmonaeans
and perhaps also Sadducees), but nothing in the surviving text
positively supports their cautiously presented surmise. However, the
second half of the fragment can be interpreted in a positive sense, in
which case the scene may be a last-minute mass conversion of
unfaithful Jews before the final battle.
For the editio princeps, see Esther Eshel and Menahem Kister,
DJD, XXXVI, 446-9.

The Thanksgiving Hymns
(IQH, IQ36, 4Q427-32)
The Hymns Scroll was published by E. L. Sukenik in 1954-5 (The
Dead Sea Scrolls of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem). It has
suffered a good deal of deterioration and the translator has difficulty,
not only in making sense of the poems, but also in determining where
one ends and another begins. For a method of restoration of the
Hymns, see E. Puech, ‘Quelques aspects de la restauration du
Rouleau des Hymnes’, JJS 39 (1988), 38-55. He has convincingly
argued that apart from some fragments, the first three columns of the
original Hymns Scroll are lost. The missing beginning should be
followed by the existing columns in the following order: XVII (sheet 1),
XIII-XVI (sheet 2), I-IV (sheet 3), V-VIII (sheet 4) and IX-XII of the editio
princeps. Four further columns (XXI-XXIV) may be reconstructed with
the help of the former col. XVIII and various fragments published by
Sukenik. Puech tentatively suggests also two further columns (XXV-
XXVI) made up from other fragments.
Our presentation of the Hymns is now rearranged according to
Puech’s thesis and his reconstruction of the poem in col. VI (formerly
XIV) is also adopted (cf. art. cit., 53-4). No translation is offered for the
extremely fragmentary cols. XXIV-XXVI, though it should be noted that
col. xxv includes the beginning of a new poem, ‘For the Master. A
s[ong (?)]’ from IQH, fr. 8. Further fragments, occasionally used to
improve the reading of IQH, may be found at IQ35 (cf. also IQ36 and
37-40; see DJD, I, 136-43) and 4Q427-32; for the latter, see Eileen
Schuller, DJD, XXIX, 69-232.
The poems contained in the Scroll are similar to the biblical Psalms.
They are mostly hymns of thanksgiving, individual prayers as opposed
to those intended for communal worship, expressing a rich variety of
spiritual and doctrinal detail. But the two fundamental themes running

through the whole collection are those of salvation and knowledge. The
sectary thanks God continually for having been saved from the ‘lot’ of
the wicked, and for his gift of insight into the divine mysteries. He, a
‘creature of clay’, has been singled out by his Maker to receive favours
of which he feels himself unworthy and he alludes again and again to
his frailty and total dependence on God. Whereas some of the Hymns
give expression to thoughts and sentiments common to all the
members of the sect, others, particularly nos. 1, 2, and 7-11, appear to
refer to the experiences of a teacher abandoned by his friends and
persecuted by his enemies. Several scholars tend to ascribe the
authorship of these to the Teacher of Righteousness, and even
consider that he may be responsible for all the Hymns. But although
this hypothesis is not impossible, no sure conclusion can yet be
reached. Nor are we in a position to date any particular composition.
The most we can say is that the collection as such probably attained its
final shape during the last pre-Christian century.
Philo’s account of the banquet celebrated by the contemplative
Essenes, or Therapeutae, on the Feast of Pentecost may indicate the
use to which the Hymns were put. He reports that when the President
of the meeting had ended his commentary on the Scriptures, he rose
and chanted a hymn, either one of his own making or an old one, and
after him each of his brethren did likewise (The Contemplative Life, §
80). Similarly, it is probable that the psalms of this Scroll were recited
by the Guardian and newly initiated members at the Feast of the
Renewal of the Covenant. Hymn 4 (formerly 21) expressly refers to the
oath of the Covenant, and Hymn 5 (formerly 22) appears to be a poetic
commentary on the liturgy marking the entry into the Community.
Indeed, the relative poverty of principal themes may be due to the fact
that all this poetry was intended for a special occasion and its
inspirational scope was thereby limited.
Cols. I-III are missing.

Hymn I (formerly 23)
As Thou hast said by the hand of Moses,
Thou forgivest transgression, iniquity, and sin,
and pardonest rebellion and unfaithfulness.
For the bases of the mountains shall melt
and fire shall consume the deep places of Hell,
but Thou wilt deliver
all those that are corrected by Thy judgements,
that they may serve Thee faithfully
and that their seed may be before Thee for ever.
Thou wilt keep Thine oath
and wilt pardon their transgression;
Thou wilt cast away all their sins.
Thou wilt cause them to inherit all the glory of Adam
and abundance of days.
Hymn 2 (formerly 24)
[I give Thee thanks]
because of the spirits which Thou hast given to me!
I [will bring forth] a reply of the tongue
to recount Thy righteous deeds,
and the forbearance ...
and the works of Thy mighty right hand,
and [the pardon] of the sins of the forefathers.
[I will bow down] and implore Thy mercy
[on my sins and wicked] deeds,
and on the perversity of [my heart],
for I have wallowed in uncleanness,
and have [turned aside] from the counsel [of Thy truth]
and I have not laboured ...
[For] Thine, Thine is righteousness,

and an everlasting blessing be upon Thy Name!
[According to] Thy righteousness,
let [Thy servant] be redeemed
[and] the wicked be brought to an end.
For I have understood that [it is Thou
who dost establish] the path of whomsoever Thou choosest;
Thou dost hedge him in with [true] discernment
that he may not sin against Thee,
and that his humility [may bear fruit]
through Thy chastisement.
[Thou dost purify] his heart in [Thy trials].
[Preserve] Thy servant, [O God], lest he sin against Thee,
or stagger aside from any word of Thy will.
Strengthen the [loins of Thy servant
that he may] resist the spirits [of falsehood,
that] he may walk in all that Thou lovest,
and despise all that Thou loathest,
[that he may do] that which is good in Thine eyes.
[Destroy] their [dominion] in my bowels,
for [within] Thy servant is a spirit of [flesh].
Hymn 3 (formerly 25)
[I thank Thee, O Lord,
for] Thou didst shed [Thy] Holy Spirit upon Thy Servant
V (formerly XIII)
All these things [Thou didst establish in Thy wisdom.
Thou didst appoint] all Thy works
before ever creating them:

and the Congregation [of Thy Holy Ones,
the heavens and all] their hosts
and the earth and all it brings forth.

And the work of ...
and they shall recount Thy glory
throughout all Thy dominion
For Thou hast shown them that
which they had not [seen
by removing all] ancient things
and creating new ones,
by breaking asunder things anciently established,
and raising up the things of eternity.
For [Thou art from the beginning]
and shalt endure for ages without end.
And Thou hast [appointed] all these things
in the mysteries of Thy wisdom
to make known Thy glory [to all].
[But what is] the spirit of flesh
that it should understand all this,
and that it should comprehend
the great [design of Thy wisdom]?
What is he that is born of woman
in the midst of all Thy terrible [works]?
He is but an edifice of dust,
and a thing kneaded with water,
whose beginning [is sinful iniquity],
and shameful nakedness,
[and a fount of uncleanness],
and over whom a spirit of straying rules.
If he is wicked he shall become [a sign for] ever,
and a wonder to (every) generation,
[and an object of horror to all] flesh.
By Thy goodness alone is man righteous,

and with Thy many mercies [Thou strengthenest him].
Thou wilt adorn him with Thy splendour
and wilt [cause him to reign amid] many delights
with everlasting peace and length of days.
[For Thou hast spoken],
and Thou wilt not take back Thy word.
And I, Thy servant,
I know by the spirit which Thou hast given to me
[that Thy words are truth],
and that all Thy works are righteousness,
and that Thou wilt not take back Thy word

Hymn 4 (formerly 21)
[Blessed art Thou,] O Lord
who hast given understanding
to the heart of [Thy] servant
that he may understand all these things
and resist [the works] of wickedness
and bless justly all those who choose Thy will,
[and that he may love all] that Thou lovest
and loathe all that Thou [hatest].
Thou shalt instruct Thy servant

for Thou hast cast their (lot) according to the spirits
between good and evil
to accomplish their task.
And I know through the understanding
which comes from Thee,
that in Thy goodwill towards m[a]n
[Thou hast] increa[sed his inheritance] in Thy Holy Spirit
and thus Thou hast drawn me near to understanding of Thee.
And the closer I approach,
the more am I filled with zeal

against all the workers of iniquity
and the men of deceit.
For none of those who approach Thee
rebels against Thy command,
nor do any of those who know Thee
alter Thy words;
for Thou art righteous,
and all Thine elect are truth.
Thou wilt blot out all injustice and wickedness for ever,
and Thy righteousness shall be revealed
before the eyes of all Thy creatures.
I know through Thy great goodness;
and with an oath I have undertaken
never to sin against Thee,
nor to do anything evil in Thine eyes.
And thus do I bring into community
all the men of my Council.
I will cause each man to draw near
in accordance with his understanding,
and according to the greatness of his inheritance,
so will I love him.
I will not honour an evil man,
nor consider [the bribes of shame];
I will [not] barter Thy truth for riches,
nor one of Thy precepts for bribes.
But [I will lo]ve [each ma]n
according to his sp[eech](?)
and according as Thou removest him far from Thee,
so will I hate him;
and none of those who have turned [from] Thy [Co]venant
will I bring into the Council [of Thy] t[ruth].

Hymn 5 (formerly 22)
[I thank] Thee, O Lord,
as befits the greatness of Thy power
and the multitude of Thy marvels for ever and ever.
[Thou art a merciful God] and rich in [favours],
pardoning those who repent of their sin
and visiting the iniquity of the wicked.
[Thou delightest in] the free-will offering [of the righteous]
but iniquity Thou hatest always.
Thou hast favoured me, Thy servant,
with a spirit of knowledge,
[that I may choose] truth [and goodness]
and loathe all the ways of iniquity.
And I have loved Thee freely
and with all my heart;
[contemplating the mysteries of] Thy wisdom
[I have sought Thee].
For this is from Thy hand
and [nothing is done] without [Thy will].
VII (formerly XV)
I have loved Thee freely
and with all my heart and soul
I have purified...
[that I might not] turn aside from any of Thy commands.
I have clung to the Congregation...
that I might not be separated from any of Thy laws.
I know through the understanding which comes from Thee
that righteousness is not in a hand of flesh,
[that] man [is not master of] his way
and that it is not in mortals to direct their step.
I know that the inclination of every spirit
[is in Thy hand];
Thou didst establish [all] its [ways] before ever creating it,
and how can any man change Thy words?

## Page 302

Thou alone didst [create] the just
and establish him from the womb
for the time of goodwill,
that he might hearken to Thy Covenant
and walk in all (Thy ways),
and that [Thou mightest show Thyself great] to him
in the multitude of Thy mercies,
and enlarge his straitened soul to eternal salvation,
to perpetual and unfailing peace.
Thou wilt raise up his glory
from among flesh.
But the wicked Thou didst create
for [the time] of Thy [wrath],
Thou didst vow them from the womb
to the Day of Massacre,
for they walk in the way which is not good.
They have despised [Thy Covenant]
and their souls have loathed Thy [truth];
they have taken no delight in all Thy commandments
and have chosen that which Thou hatest.
[For according to the mysteries] of Thy [wisdom],
Thou hast ordained them for great chastisements
before the eyes of all Thy creatures,
that [for all] eternity
they may serve as a sign [and a wonder],
and that [all men] may know Thy glory
and Thy tremendous power.
But what is flesh
that it should understand [these things]?
And how should [a creature of] dust direct his steps?
It is Thou who didst shape the spirit
and establish its work [from the beginning];
the way of all the living proceeds from Thee.

I know that no riches equal Thy truth,
and [have therefore desired
to enter the Council of] Thy holiness.
I know that Thou hast chosen them before all others
and that they shall serve Thee for ever.
Thou wilt [take no bribe for the deeds of iniquity],
nor ransom for the works of wickedness;
for Thou art a God of truth
and [wilt destroy] all iniquity [for ever,
and] no [wickedness] shall exist before Thee.
VIII (formerly XVI)
Because I know all these things
my tongue shall utter a reply.
Bowing down and [confessing all] my transgressions,
I will seek [Thy] spirit [of knowledge];
cleaving to Thy spirit of [holiness],
I will hold fast to the truth of Thy Covenant,
that [I may serve] Thee in truth and wholeness of heart,
and that I may love [Thy Name].
Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
Maker [of all things and mighty in] deeds:
all things are Thy work!
Behold, Thou art pleased to favour [Thy servant],
and hast graced me with Thy spirit of mercy
and [with the radiance] of Thy glory.
Thine, Thine is righteousness,
for it is Thou who hast done all [these things]!
I know that Thou hast marked the spirit of the just,
and therefore I have chosen to keep my hands clean
in accordance with [Thy] will:
the soul of Thy servant [has loathed]
every work of iniquity.
And I know that man is not righteous

except through Thee,
and therefore I implore Thee
by the spirit which Thou hast given [me]
to perfect Thy [favours] to Thy servant [for ever],
purifying me by Thy Holy Spirit,
and drawing me near to Thee by Thy grace
according to the abundance of Thy mercies
[Grant me] the place [of Thy loving-kindness]
which [Thou hast] chosen for them that love Thee
and keep [Thy commandments,
that they may stand] in Thy presence [for] ever.
Let no scourge [come] near him
lest he stagger aside from the laws of Thy Covenant.
I [know, O Lord,
that Thou art merciful] and compassionate,
[long]-suffering and [rich] in grace and truth,
pardoning transgression [and sin].
Thou repentest of [evil against them that love Thee]
and keep [Thy] commandments,
[that] return to Thee with faith
and wholeness of heart
... to serve Thee
[and to do that which is] good in Thine eyes.
Reject not the face of Thy servant
Hymn 6 (formerly I)
IX (formerly I)
Thou art long-suffering in Thy judgements
and righteous in all Thy deeds.
By Thy wisdom [all things exist from] eternity,
and before creating them Thou knewest their works
for ever and ever.
[Nothing] is done [without Thee]
and nothing is known unless Thou desire it.

Thou hast created all the spirits
[and hast established a statute] and law
for all their works.
Thou hast spread the heavens for Thy glory
and hast [appointed] all [their hosts]
according to Thy will;
the mighty winds according to their laws
before they became angels [of holiness]
... and eternal spirits in their dominions;
the heavenly lights to their mysteries,
the stars to their paths,
[the clouds] to their tasks,
the thunderbolts and lightnings to their duty,
and the perfect treasuries (of snow and hail)
to their purposes,
... to their mysteries.
Thou hast created the earth by Thy power
and the seas and deeps [by Thy might].
Thou hast fashioned [all] their [inhabi]tants
according to Thy wisdom,
and hast appointed all that is in them
according to Thy will.
[And] to the spirit of man
which Thou hast formed in the world,
[Thou hast given dominion over the works of Thy hands]
for everlasting days and unending generations.
... in their ages
Thou hast allotted to them tasks
during all their generations,
and judgement in their appointed seasons
according to the rule [of the two spirits.
For Thou hast established their ways]
for ever and ever,

## Page 306

[and hast ordained from eternity]
their visitation for reward and chastisements;
Thou hast allotted it to all their seed
for eternal generations and everlasting years...
In the wisdom of Thy knowledge
Thou didst establish their destiny before ever they were.
All things [exist] according to [Thy will]
and without Thee nothing is done.
These things I know
by the wisdom which comes from Thee,
for Thou hast unstopped my ears
to marvellous mysteries.
And yet I, a shape of clay
kneaded in water,
a ground of shame
and a source of pollution,
a melting-pot of wickedness
and an edifice of sin,
a straying and perverted spirit
of no understanding,
fearful of righteous judgements,
what can I say that is not foreknown,
and what can I utter that is not foretold?
All things are graven before Thee
on a written Reminder
for everlasting ages,
and for the numbered cycles
of the eternal years
in all their seasons;
they are not hidden or absent from Thee.
What shall a man say
concerning his sin?


---

## Page 307

And how shall he plead
concerning his iniquities?
And how shall he reply
to righteous judgement?
For Thine, O God of knowledge,
are all righteous deeds
and the counsel of truth;
but to the sons of men is the work of iniquity
and deeds of deceit.
It is Thou who hast created breath for the tongue
and Thou knowest its words;
Thou didst establish the fruit of the lips
before ever they were.
Thou dost set words to measure
and the flow of breath from the lips to metre.
Thou bringest forth sounds
according to their mysteries,
and the flow of breath from the lips
according to its reckoning,
that they may tell of Thy glory
and recount Thy wonders
in all Thy works of truth
and [in all Thy] righteous [judgements];
and that Thy Name be praised
by the mouth of all men,
and that they may know Thee
according to their understanding
and bless Thee for ever.
By Thy mercies and by Thy great goodness,
Thou hast strengthened the spirit of man
in the face of the scourge,
and hast purified [the erring spirit]
of a multitude of sins,
that it may declare Thy marvels

in the presence of all Thy creatures.
[I will declare to the assembly of the simple]
the judgements by which I was scourged,
and to the sons of men, all Thy wonders
by which Thou hast shown Thyself mighty [in me
in the presence of the sons of Adam].
Hear, O you wise men, and meditate on knowledge;
O you fearful, be steadfast!
Increase in prudence, [O all you simple];
O just men, put away iniquity!
Hold fast [to the Covenant],
O all you perfect of way;
[O all you afflicted with] misery,
be patient and despise no righteous judgement!
[but the foo]lish of heart
shall not comprehend these things
X (formerly II)
Upon my [uncircumcised] lips
Thou hast laid a reply.
Thou hast upheld my soul,
strengthening my loins and restoring my power;
my foot has stood in the realm of ungodliness.
I have been a snare to those who rebel,
but healing to those of them who repent,
prudence to the simple,
and steadfastness to the fearful of heart.
To traitors Thou hast made of me
a mockery and scorn,
but a counsel of truth and understanding
to the upright of way.
I have been iniquity for the wicked,
ill-repute on the lips of the fierce,
the scoffers have gnashed their teeth.
I have been a byword to traitors,

the assembly of the wicked has raged against me;
they have roared like turbulent seas
and their towering waves have spat out mud and slime.
But to the elect of righteousness
Thou hast made me a banner,
and a discerning interpreter of wonderful mysteries,
to try [those who practise] truth
and to test those who love correction.
To the interpreters of error I have been an opponent,
[but a man of peace] to all those who see true things.
To all those who seek smooth things
I have been a spirit of zeal;
like the sound of the roaring of many waters
so have [all] the deceivers thundered against me;
[all] their thoughts were devilish [schemings].
They have cast towards the Pit the life of the man
whose mouth Thou hast confirmed,
and into whose heart
Thou hast put teaching and understanding,
that he might open a fountain of knowledge
to all men of insight.
They have exchanged them for lips of uncircumcision,
and for the foreign tongue
of a people without understanding,
that they might come to ruin in their straying.
Hymn 7 (formerly 2)
I thank Thee, O Lord,
for Thou hast placed my soul
in the bundle of the living,
and hast hedged me about
against all the snares of the Pit.
Violent men have sought after my life

## Page 310

because I have clung to Thy Covenant.
For they, an assembly of deceit,
and a horde of Belial,
know not that my stand
is maintained by Thee,
and that in Thy mercy Thou wilt save my soul
since my steps proceed from Thee.
From Thee it is
that they assail my life,
that Thou mayest be glorified
by the judgement of the wicked,
and manifest Thy might through me
in the presence of the sons of men;
for it is by Thy mercy that I stand.
And I said, Mighty men
have pitched their camps against me,
and have encompassed me
with all their weapons of war.
They have let fly arrows
against which there is no cure,
and the flame of (their) javelins
is like a consuming fire among trees.
The clamour of their shouting
is like the bellowing of many waters,
like a storm of destruction
devouring a multitude of men;
as their waves rear up,
Naught and Vanity spout upward to the stars.
But although my heart melted like water,
my soul held fast to Thy Covenant,
and the net which they spread for me
has taken their own foot;
they have themselves fallen
into the snares which they laid for my life.

But my foot remains upon level ground;
apart from their assembly I will bless Thy Name.
Hymn 8 (formerly 3)
I thank Thee, O Lord,
for Thou hast [fastened] Thine eye upon me.
Thou hast saved me from the zeal
of lying interpreters,
and from the congregation of those
who seek smooth things.
Thou hast redeemed the soul of the poor one
whom they planned to destroy
by spilling his blood because he served Thee.
Because [they knew not]
that my steps were directed by Thee,
they made me an object of shame and derision
in the mouth of all the seekers of falsehood.
But Thou, O my God, hast succoured
the soul of the poor and the needy
against one stronger than he;
Thou hast redeemed my soul
from the hand of the mighty.
Thou hast not permitted their insults to dismay me
so that I forsook Thy service
for fear of the wickedness of the [ungodly],
or bartered my steadfast heart for folly
Hymn 9(formerly 4)

They caused [me] to be

[and] like a woman in travail
with her first-born child,
upon whose belly pangs have come
and grievous pains,
filling with anguish her child-bearing crucible.
For the children have come to the throes of Death,
and she labours in her pains who bears a man.
For amid the throes of Death
she shall bring forth a man-child,
and amid the pains of Hell
there shall spring from her child-bearing crucible
a Marvellous Mighty Counsellor;
and a man shall be delivered from out of the throes.
When he is conceived
all wombs shall quicken,
and the time of their delivery
shall be in grievous pains;
they shall be appalled
who are with child.
And when he is brought forth
every pang shall come upon the child-bearing crucible.
And they, the conceivers of Vanity,
shall be prey to terrible anguish;
the wombs of the Pit
shall be prey to all the works of horror.
The foundations of the wall shall rock
like a ship upon the face of the waters;
the heavens shall roar
with a noise of roaring,
and those who dwell in the dust,
as well as those who sail the seas,
shall be appalled by the roaring of the waters.

All their wise men
shall be like sailors on the deeps,
for all their wisdom shall be swallowed up

As the Abysses boil
above the fountains of the waters,

with the voice of their roaring;
and as they rage,
[Hell and Abaddon] shall open
[and all] the flying arrows of the Pit
shall send out their voice to the Abyss.
And the gates [of Hell] shall open
[on all] the works of Vanity;
and the doors of the Pit shall close
on the conceivers of wickedness;
and the everlasting bars shall be bolted
on all the spirits of Naught.
Hymn 10 (formerly 5)
I thank Thee, O Lord,
for Thou hast redeemed my soul from the Pit,
and from the hell of Abaddon
Thou hast raised me up to everlasting height.
I walk on limitless level ground,
and I know there is hope for him
whom Thou hast shaped from dust
for the everlasting Council.
Thou hast cleansed a perverse spirit of great sin
that it may stand with the host of the Holy Ones,
and that it may enter into community
with the congregation of the Sons of Heaven.

Thou hast allotted to man an everlasting destiny
amidst the spirits of knowledge,
that he may praise Thy Name in a common rejoicing
and recount Thy marvels before all Thy works.
And yet I, a creature of clay,
what am I?
Kneaded with water,
what is my worth and my might?
For I have stood in the realm of wickedness
and my lot was with the damned;
the soul of the poor one was carried away
in the midst of great tribulation.
Miseries of torment dogged my steps
while all the snares of the Pit were opened
and the lures of wickedness were set up
and the nets of the damned (were spread) on the waters;
while all the arrows of the Pit
flew out without cease,
and, striking, left no hope;
while the rope beat down in judgement
and a destiny of wrath (fell) upon the abandoned
and a venting of fury upon the cunning.
It was a time of the wrath of all Belial
and the bonds of death tightened without any escape.
The torrents of Belial shall reach
to all sides of the world.
In all their channels
a consuming fire shall destroy
every tree, green and barren, on their banks;
unto the end of their courses
it shall scourge with flames of fire,
and shall consume the foundations of the earth
and the expanse of dry land.
The bases of the mountains shall blaze

## Page 315

and the roots of the rocks shall turn
to torrents of pitch;
it shall devour as far as the great Abyss.
The torrents of Belial shall break into Abaddon,
and the deeps of the Abyss shall groan
amid the roar of heaving mud.
The land shall cry out because of the calamity
fallen upon the world,
and all its deeps shall howl.
And all those upon it shall rave
and shall perish amid the great misfortune.
For God shall sound His mighty voice,
and His holy abode shall thunder
with the truth of His glory.
The heavenly hosts shall cry out
and the world’s foundations
shall stagger and sway.
The war of the heavenly warriors shall scourge the earth;
and it shall not end before the appointed destruction
which shall be for ever and without compare.
Hymn 11 (formerly 6)
I thank Thee, O Lord,

I seek Thee,
and sure as the dawn
Thou appearest as [perfect Light] to me.
Teachers of lies [have smoothed] Thy people [with words],
and [false prophets] have led them astray;
they perish without understanding
for their works are in folly.
For I am despised by them
and they have no esteem for me
that Thou mayest manifest Thy might through me.
They have banished me from my land like a bird from its nest;
all my friends and brethren are driven far from me
and hold me for a broken vessel.
And they, teachers of lies and seers of falsehood,
have schemed against me a devilish scheme,
to exchange the Law engraved on my heart by Thee
for the smooth things (which they speak) to Thy people.
And they withhold from the thirsty the drink of Knowledge,
and assuage their thirst with vinegar,
that they may gaze on their straying,
on their folly concerning their feast-days,
on their fall into their snares.
But Thou, O God,
dost despise all Belial’s designs;
it is Thy purpose that shall be done
and the design of Thy heart
that shall be established for ever.
As for them, they dissemble,
they plan devilish schemes.
They seek Thee with a double heart
and are not confirmed in Thy truth
A root bearing poisoned and bitter fruit
is in their designs;

they walk in stubbornness of heart
and seek Thee among idols,
and they set before themselves
the stumbling-block of their sin.
They come to inquire of Thee
from the mouth of lying prophets deceived by error
who speak [with strange] lips to Thy people,
and an alien tongue,
that they may cunningly turn
all their works to folly.
For [they hearken] not [to] Thy [voice],
nor do they give ear to Thy word;
of the vision of knowledge they say, ‘It is unsure’,
and of the way of Thy heart, ‘It is not (the way)’.
But Thou, O God, wilt reply to them,
chastising them in Thy might
because of their idols
and because of the multitude of their sins,
that they who have turned aside from Thy Covenant
may be caught in their own designs.
Thou wilt destroy in Judgement
all men of lies,
and there shall be no more seers of error;
for in Thy works is no folly,
no guile in the design of Thy heart.
But those who please Thee
shall stand before Thee for ever;
those who walk in the way of Thy heart
shall be established for evermore.
Clinging to Thee, I will stand.
I will rise against those who despise me
and my hand shall be turned
against those who deride me;

## Page 318

for they have no esteem for me
[that Thou mayest] manifest Thy might through me.
Thou hast revealed Thyself to me in Thy power
as perfect Light,
and Thou hast not covered my face with shame.
All those who are gathered in Thy Covenant
inquire of me,
and they hearken to me who walk in the way of Thy heart,
who array themselves for Thee
in the Council of the holy.
Thou wilt cause their law to endure for ever
and truth to go forward unhindered,
and Thou wilt not allow them to be led astray
by the hand of the damned
when they plot against them.
Thou wilt put the fear of them into Thy people
and (wilt make of them) a hammer
to all the peoples of the lands,
that at the Judgement they may cut off
all those who transgress Thy word.
Through me Thou hast illumined
the face of the Congregation
and hast shown Thine infinite power.
For Thou hast given me knowledge
through Thy marvellous mysteries,
and hast shown Thyself mighty within me
in the midst of Thy marvellous Council.
Thou hast done wonders before the Congregation
for the sake of Thy glory,
that they may make known Thy mighty deeds to all the living.
But what is flesh (to be worthy) of this?
What is a creature of clay
for such great marvels to be done,

whereas he is in iniquity from the womb
and in guilty unfaithfulness until his old age?
Righteousness, I know, is not of man,
nor is perfection of way of the son of man:
to the Most High God belong all righteous deeds.
The way of man is not established
except by the spirit which God created for him
to make perfect a way for the children of men,
that all His creatures may know
the might of His power,
and the abundance of His mercies
towards all the sons of His grace.
As for me, shaking and trembling seize me
and all my bones are broken;
my heart dissolves like wax before fire
and my knees are like water
pouring down a steep place.
For I remember my sins
and the unfaithfulness of my fathers.
When the wicked rose against Thy Covenant
and the damned against Thy word,
I said in my sinfulness,
‘I am forsaken by Thy Covenant.’
But calling to mind the might of Thy hand
and the greatness of Thy compassion,
I rose and stood,
and my spirit was established
in face of the scourge.
I lean on Thy grace
and on the multitude of Thy mercies,
for Thou wilt pardon iniquity,
and through Thy righteousness
[Thou wilt purify man] of his sin.
Not for his sake wilt Thou do it,

XIII (formerly V)
Hymn 13 (formerly 8)
I thank Thee, O Lord,
for Thou hast not abandoned me
whilst I sojourned among a people [burdened with sin].
[Thou hast not] judged me
according to my guilt,
nor hast Thou abandoned me
because of the designs of my inclination;
but Thou hast saved my life from the Pit.
Thou hast brought [Thy servant deliverance]
in the midst of lions destined for the guilty,
and of lionesses which crush the bones of the mighty
and drink the blood of the brave.
Thou hast caused me to dwell with the many fishers
who spread a net upon the face of the waters,
and with the hunters of the children of iniquity;
Thou hast established me there for justice.
Thou hast confirmed the counsel of truth in my heart
and the waters of the Covenant for those who seek it.
Thou hast closed up the mouth of the young lions
whose teeth are like a sword,
and whose great teeth are like a pointed spear,
like the venom of dragons.
All their design is for robbery
and they have lain in wait;
but they have not opened their mouth against me.
For Thou, O God, hast sheltered me
from the children of men,


---

## Page 321

and hast hidden Thy Law [within me]
against the time when Thou shouldst reveal
Thy salvation to me.
For Thou hast not forsaken me
in my soul’s distress,
and Thou hast heard my cry
in the bitterness of my soul;
and when I groaned,
Thou didst consider my sorrowful complaint.
Thou hast preserved the soul of the poor one
in the den of lions
which sharpened their tongue like a sword.
Thou hast closed up their teeth, O God,
lest they rend the soul of the poor and needy.
Thou hast made their tongue go back
like a sword to its scabbard
[lest] the soul of Thy servant [be blotted out].
Thou hast dealt wondrously with the poor one
to manifest Thy might within me
in the presence of the sons of men.
Thou hast placed him in the melting-pot,
[like gold] in the fire,
and like silver refined
in the melting-pot of the smelters,
to be purified seven times.
The wicked and fierce have stormed against me
with their afflictions;
they have pounded my soul all day.
But Thou, O my God,
hast changed the tempest to a breeze;
Thou hast delivered the soul of the poor one
like [a bird from the net
and like] prey from the mouth of lions.

Hymn 14 (formerly 9)
I thank Thee (corrected: Blessed art Thou) O Lord,
for Thou hast not abandoned the fatherless
or despised the poor.
For Thy might [is boundless]
and Thy glory beyond measure
and wonderful Heroes minister to Thee;
yet [hast Thou done marvels] among the humble
in the mire underfoot,
and among those eager for righteousness,
causing all the well-loved poor
to rise up together from the trampling.
But I have been [iniquity to] those who contend with me,
dispute and quarrelling to my friends,
wrath to the members of my Covenant
and murmuring and protest to all my companions.
[All who have ea]ten my bread
have lifted their heel against me,
and all those joined to my Council
have mocked me with wicked lips.
The members of my [Covenant] have rebelled
and have murmured round about me;
they have gone as talebearers
before the children of mischief
concerning the mystery which Thou hast hidden in me.
And to show Thy great[ness] through me,
and because of their guilt,
Thou hast hidden the fountain of understanding
and the counsel of truth.
They consider but the mischief of their heart;
[with] devilish [schemings] they unsheathe

a perfidious tongue
from which ever springs the poison of dragons.
And like (serpents) which creep in the dust,
so do they let fly [their poisonous darts],
viper’s [venom] against which there is no charm;
and this has brought incurable pain,
a malignant scourge
within the body of Thy servant,
causing [his spirit] to faint
and draining his strength
so that he maintains no firm stand.
They have overtaken me in a narrow pass without escape
and there is no [rest for me in my trial].
They sound my censure upon a harp
and their murmuring and storming upon a zither.
Anguish [seizes me]
like the pangs of a woman in travail,
and my heart is troubled within me.
I am clothed in blackness
and my tongue cleaves to the roof [of my mouth];
[for I fear the mischief of] their heart
and their inclination (towards evil)
appears as bitterness before me.
The light of my face is dimmed to darkness
and my radiance is turned to decay.
For Thou, O God, didst widen my heart,
but they straiten it with affliction
and hedge me about with darkness.
I eat the bread of wailing
and drink unceasing tears;
truly, my eyes are dimmed by grief,
and my soul by daily bitterness.

## Page 324

[Groaning] and sorrow encompass me
and ignominy covers my face.
My bread is turned into an adversary
and my drink into an accuser;
it has entered into my bones
causing my spirit to stagger
and my strength to fail.
According to the mysteries of sin,
they change the works of God by their transgression.
Truly, I am bound with untearable ropes
and with unbreakable chains.
A thick wall [fences me in],
iron bars and gates [of bronze];
my [prison] is counted with the Abyss
as being without [any escape]
[The torrents of Belial] have encompassed my soul
[leaving me without deliverance]
Hymn 14 (formerly 10)
XIV (formerly VI)
Thou hast unstopped my ears
[to the correction] of those who reprove with justice
[Thou hast saved me] from the congregation of [vanity]
and from the assembly of violence;
Thou hast brought me into the Council of...
[and hast purified me of] sin.
And I know there is hope
for those who turn from transgression
and for those who abandon sin
and to walk without wickedness
in the way of Thy heart.
I am consoled for the roaring of the peoples,
and for the tumult of k[ing]doms when they assemble;

## Page 325

[for] in a little while, I know,
Thou wilt raise up survivors among Thy people
and a remnant within Thine inheritance.
Thou wilt purify and cleanse them of their sin
for all their deeds are in Thy truth.
Thou wilt judge them in Thy great loving-kindness
and in the multitude of Thy mercies
and in the abundance of Thy pardon,
teaching them according to Thy word;
and Thou wilt establish them in Thy Council
according to the uprightness of Thy truth.
Thou wilt do these things for Thy glory
and for Thine own sake,
to [magnify] the Law and [the truth
and to enlighten] the members of Thy Council
in the midst of the sons of men,
that they may recount Thy marvels
for everlasting generations
and [meditate] unceasingly upon Thy mighty deeds.
All the nations shall acknowledge Thy truth,
and all the people Thy glory.
For Thou wilt bring Thy glorious [salvation]
to all the men of Thy Council,
to those who share a common lot
with the Angels of the Face.
And among them shall be no mediator to [invoke Thee],
and no messenger [to make] reply;
for ...
They shall reply according to Thy glorious word
and shall be Thy princes in the company [of the Angels].
They shall send out a bud [for ever]
like a flower [of the fields],
and shall cause a shoot to grow
into the boughs of an everlasting Plant.

It shall cover the whole [earth] with its shadow
[and its crown] (shall reach) to the [clouds];
its roots (shall go down) to the Abyss
[and all the rivers of Eden shall water its branches].
A source of light
shall become an eternal ever-flowing fountain,
and in its bright flames
all the [sons of iniquity] shall be consumed;
[it shall be] a fire to devour all sinful men
in utter destruction.
They who bore the yoke of my testimony
have been led astray [by teachers of lies],
[and have rebelled] against the service of righteousness.
Whereas Thou, O my God, didst command them
to mend their ways
[by walking] in the way of [holiness],
where no man goes who is uncircumcised
or unclean or violent,
they have staggered aside from the way of Thy heart
and languish in [great] wretchedness.
A counsel of Belial is in their heart
[and in accordance with] their wicked design
they wallow in sin.
[I am] as a sailor in a ship
amid furious seas;
their waves and all their billows
roar against me.
[There is no] calm in the whirlwind
that I may restore my soul,
no path that I may straighten my way
on the face of the waters.
The deeps resound to my groaning

## Page 327

and [my soul has journeyed] to the gates of death.
But I shall be as one who enters a fortified city,
as one who seeks refuge behind a high wall
until deliverance (comes);
I will [lean on] Thy truth, O my God.
For Thou wilt set the foundation on rock
and the framework by the measuring-cord of justice;
and the tried stones [Thou wilt lay]
by the plumb-line [of truth],
to [build] a mighty [wall] which shall not sway;
and no man entering there shall stagger.
For no enemy shall ever invade [it
since its doors shall be] doors of protection
through which no man shall pass;
and its bars shall be firm
and no man shall break them.
No rabble shall enter in with their weapons of war
until all the [arrows] of the war of wickedness
have come to an end.
And then at the time of Judgement
the Sword of God shall hasten,
and all the sons of His truth shall awake
to [overthrow] wickedness;
all the sons of iniquity shall be no more.
The Hero shall bend his bow;
the fortress shall open on to endless space
and the everlasting gates shall send out weapons of war.
They shall be mighty
from end to end [of the earth
and there shall be no escape]
for the guilty of heart [in their battle];
they shall be utterly trampled down

There shall be no] hope
in the greatness [of their might],
no refuge for the mighty warriors;
for [the battle shall be] to the Most High God
Hoist a banner,
O you who lie in the dust!
O bodies gnawed by worms,
raise up an ensign for [the destruction of wickedness]!
[The sinful shall] be destroyed
in the battles against the ungodly.
The scourging flood when it advances
shall not invade the stronghold
XV (formerly VII)
As for me, I am dumb ...
[my arm] is torn from its shoulder
and my foot has sunk into the mire.
My eyes are closed by the spectacle of evil,
and my ears by the crying of blood.
My heart is dismayed by the mischievous design,
for Belial is manifest in their (evil) inclination.
All the foundations of my edifice totter
and my bones are pulled out of joint;
my bowels heave like a ship in a violent tempest
and my heart is utterly distressed.
A whirlwind engulfs me
because of the mischief of their sin.
Hymn 15 (formerly 11)
I thank Thee, O Lord,
for Thou hast upheld me by Thy strength.
Thou hast shed Thy Holy Spirit upon me
that I may not stumble.

## Page 329

Thou hast strengthened me
before the battles of wickedness,
and during all their disasters
Thou hast not permitted that fear
should cause me to desert Thy Covenant.
Thou hast made me like a strong tower, a high wall,
and hast established my edifice upon rock;
eternal foundations
serve for my ground,
and all my ramparts are a tried wall
which shall not sway.
Thou hast placed me, O my God,
among the branches of the Council of Holiness;
Thou hast [established my mouth] in Thy Covenant,
and my tongue is like that of Thy disciples;
whereas the spirit of disaster is without a mouth
and all the sons of iniquity without a reply;
for the lying lips shall be dumb.
For Thou wilt condemn in Judgement
all those who assail me,
distinguishing through me
between the just and the wicked.
For Thou knowest the whole intent of a creature,
Thou discernest every reply,
and Thou hast established my heart
[on] Thy teaching and truth,
directing my steps into the paths of righteousness
that I may walk before Thee
in the land [of the living],
into paths of glory and [infinite] peace
which shall [never] end.
For Thou knowest the inclination of Thy servant,
that I have not relied [upon the works of my hands]
to raise up [my heart],
nor have I sought refuge


---

## Page 330

in my own strength.
I have no fleshly refuge,
[and Thy servant has] no righteous deeds
to deliver him from the [Pit of no] forgiveness.
But I lean on the [abundance of Thy mercies]
and hope [for the greatness] of Thy grace,
that Thou wilt bring [salvation] to flower
and the branch to growth,
providing refuge in (Thy) strength
[and raising up my heart].
[For in] Thy righteousness
Thou hast appointed me for Thy Covenant,
and I have clung to Thy truth
and [gone forward in Thy ways].
Thou hast made me a father to the sons of grace,
and as a foster-father to men of marvel;
they have opened their mouths like little babes ...
like a child playing in the lap of its nurse.
Thou hast lifted my horn above those who insult me,
and those who attack me
[sway like the boughs] (of a tree);
my enemies are like chaff before the wind,
and my dominion is over the sons [of iniquity,
For] Thou hast succoured my soul, O my God,
and hast lifted my horn on high.
And I shall shine in a seven-fold light
in [the Council appointed by] Thee for Thy glory;
for Thou art an everlasting heavenly light to me
and wilt establish my feet
[upon level ground for ever].
Hymn 16 (formerly 12)
I [thank Thee, O Lord],

## Page 331

for Thou hast enlightened me through Thy truth.
In Thy marvellous mysteries,
and in Thy loving-kindness to a man [of vanity,
and] in the greatness of Thy mercy to a perverse heart
Thou hast granted me knowledge.
Who is like Thee among the gods, O Lord,
and who is according to Thy truth?
Who, when he is judged,
shall be righteous before Thee?
For no spirit can reply to Thy rebuke
nor can any withstand Thy wrath.
Yet Thou bringest all the sons of Thy truth
in forgiveness before Thee,
[to cleanse] them of their faults
through Thy great goodness,
and to establish them before Thee
through the multitude of Thy mercies
for ever and ever.
For Thou art an eternal God;
all Thy ways are determined for ever [and ever]
and there is none other beside Thee.
And what is a man of Naught and Vanity
that he should understand Thy marvellous mighty deeds?
Hymn 17 (formerly 13)
[I thank] Thee, O God,
for Thou hast not cast my lot
in the congregation of Vanity,
nor hast Thou placed {my decree} (4Q428 7)
in the council of the cunning.
[Thou hast] called me to Thy grace
and to [Thy] forgiveness Thou hast brought me,

## Page 332

and, by the multitude of Thy mercies,
to all judgements of [righteousness.
As for me, I am an] uncl[ean ma]n,
and from the womb of her who conceived me
I am an unclean man,
and from the womb of her who has conceived me
I am in sinful guilt,
[and from the breast of my mother] in injustice,
and in the bosom [of my nurse] in great impurity.
And from my youth (I am) in blo[od,
and until [my old age in the iniquity of the flesh.
But Thou,] O my God,
Thou hast established my feet in the way of Thy heart,
and hast opened] my ears to [Thy wonderful] tidings,
and my heart to understand Thy truth
XVI (formerly VIII)
for I have closed my ears to Thy teaching
until...
... [without] knowledge
hast Thou cut out of me,
and glor[y] ...
[no] more for me a stumbling-block of iniquity.
For Thou dost rev[eal Thy salvation],
and Thy righteousness is made firm for ever.
For m[an] is not the master of his way,
f[or] Thou hast done [all this for Thy glory.]
Hymn 18 (formerly 14)
I [thank Thee, O Lord,
for] Thou hast placed me beside a fountain of streams
in an arid land,
and close to a spring of waters
in a dry land,
and beside a watered garden
[in a wilderness].


---

## Page 333

[For Thou didst set] a plantation
of cypress, pine, and cedar for Thy glory,
trees of life beside a mysterious fountain
hidden among the trees by the water,
and they put out a shoot
of the everlasting Plant.
But before they did so, they took root
and sent out their roots to the watercourse
that its stem might be open to the living waters
and be one with the everlasting spring.
And all [the beasts] of the forest
fed on its leafy boughs;
its stem was trodden by all who passed on the way
and its branches by all the birds.
And all the [trees] by the water rose above it
for they grew in their plantation;
but they sent out no root to the watercourse.
And the bud of the shoot of holiness
of the Plant of truth
was hidden and was not esteemed;
and being unperceived,
its mystery was sealed.
Thou didst hedge in its fruit, [O God],
with the mystery of mighty Heroes
and of spirits of holiness
and of the whirling flame of fire.
No [man shall approach] the well-spring of life
or drink the waters of holiness
with the everlasting trees,
or bear fruit with [the Plant] of heaven,
who seeing has not discerned,
and considering has not believed


---

## Page 334

in the fountain of life,
who has turned [his hand against] the everlasting [bud].
And I was despised by tumultuous rivers
for they cast up their slime upon me.
But Thou, O my God, hast put into my mouth
as it were rain for all [those who thirst]
and a fount of living waters which shall not fail.
When they are opened they shall not run dry;
they shall be a torrent [overflowing its banks]
and like the [bottom]less seas.
They shall suddenly gush forth
which were hidden in secret,
[and shall be like the waters of the Flood
to every tree], both the green and the barren;
to every beast and bird [they shall be an abyss.
The trees shall sink like] lead in the mighty waters,
fire [shall burn among them]
and they shall be dried up;
but the fruitful Plant
[by the] everlasting [spring
shall be] an Eden of glory
[bearing] fruits [of life].
By my hand Thou hast opened for them
a well-spring and ditches,
[that all their channels] may be laid out
according to a certain measuring-cord,
and the planting of their trees
according to the plumb-line of the sun,
that [their boughs may become
a beautiful] Branch of glory.
When I lift my hand to dig its ditches
its roots shall run deep into hardest rock

## Page 335

and its stem ... in the earth;
in the season of heat it shall keep its strength.
But if I take away my hand
it shall be like a thistle [in the wilderness];
its stem shall be like nettles in a salty land,
and thistles and thorns shall grow from its ditches,
and brambles and briars.
Its border [trees] shall be like the wild grapevine
whose foliage withers before the heat,
and its stem shall not be open to [the spring].
[Behold, I am] carried away with the sick;
[I am acquainted] with scourges.
I am forsaken in [my sorrow] ...
and without any strength.
For my sore breaks out in bitter pains
and in incurable sickness impossible to stay;
[my heart laments] within me
as in those who go down to Hell.
My spirit is imprisoned with the dead
for [my life] has reached the Pit;
my soul languishes [within me]
day and night without rest.
My wound breaks out like burning fire
shut up in [my bones],
whose flames devour me for days on end,
diminishing my strength for times on end
and destroying my flesh for seasons on end.
The pains fly out [towards me]
and my soul within me languishes even to death.
My strength has gone from my body
and my heart runs out like water;
my flesh is dissolved like wax
and the strength of my loins is turned to fear.

## Page 336

My arm is torn from its socket
[and I can] lift my hand [no more];
My [foot] is held by fetters
and my knees slide like water;
I can no longer walk.
I cannot step forward lightly,
[for my legs and arms] are bound by shackles
which cause me to stumble.
The tongue has gone back which Thou didst make
marvellously mighty within my mouth;
it can no longer give voice.
[I have no word] for my disciples
to revive the spirit of those who stumble
and to speak words of support to the weary.
My circumcised lips are dumb.
XVII (formerly IX)
[For] the throes of death [encompass me]
and Hell is upon my bed;
my couch utters a lamentation
[and my pallet] the sound of a complaint.
My eyes are like fire in the furnace
and my tears like rivers of water;
my eyes grow dim with waiting,
[for my salvation] is far from me
and my life is apart from me.
But behold,
from desolation to ruin,
and from the pain to the sore,
and from the travail to the throes,
my soul meditates on Thy marvellous works.
In Thy mercies Thou hast not cast me aside;
season by season, my soul shall delight
in the abundance of mercy.
I will reply to him who slanders me

## Page 337

and I will rebuke my oppressor;
I will declare his sentence unjust
and declare Thy judgement righteous.
For I know by Thy truth,
and I choose Thy judgement upon me:
I delight in my scourges
for I hope for Thy loving-kindness.
Thou hast put a supplication
in the mouth of Thy servant
and Thou hast not threatened my life
nor rejected my peace.
Thou hast not failed my expectation,
but hast upheld my spirit in face of the scourge.
For it is Thou who hast founded my spirit
and Thou knowest my intent;
in my distress Thou hast comforted me.
I delight in forgiveness,
and am consoled for the former transgression;
for I know there is hope in Thy grace
and expectation in Thy great power.
For no man can be just in Thy judgement
or [righteous in] Thy trial.
Though one man be more just than another,
one person [more] wise [than another],
one mortal more glorious
than another creature [of clay],
yet is there no power to compare with Thy might.
There is no [bound] to Thy glory,
and to Thy wisdom, no measure;
[to Thy truth] there is no ...
and all who forsake it ...
and my oppressor shall [not] prevail against me.
I will be a stumbling-block to [those who swallow me up,

and a snare to] all those who battle against me;
[I will be for my enemies a] cause of shame,
and a cause of disgrace
to those who murmur against me.
For Thou, O my God ...
Thou wilt plead my cause;
for it is according to the mystery of Thy wisdom
that Thou hast rebuked me.
Thou wilt conceal the truth until [its] time,
[and righteousness] until its appointed moment.
Thy rebuke shall become my joy and gladness,
and my scourges shall turn to [eternal] healing
and everlasting [peace].
The scorn of my enemies shall become a crown of glory,
and my stumbling (shall change) to everlasting might.
For in Thy ...
and my light shall shine forth in Thy glory.
For as a light from out of the darkness,
so wilt Thou enlighten me.
[Thou wilt bring healing to] my wound,
and marvellous might in place of my stumbling,
and everlasting space to my straitened soul.
For Thou art my refuge, my high mountain,
my stout rock and my fortress;
in Thee will I shelter
from all the [designs of ungodliness,
for Thou wilt succour me] with eternal deliverance.
For Thou hast known me from (the time of) my father,
[and hast chosen me] from the womb.
[From the belly of] my mother
Thou hast dealt kindly with me,
and from the breast of her who conceived me
have Thy mercies been with me.


---

## Page 339

[Thy grace was with me] in the lap of her who reared me,
and from my youth Thou hast illumined me
with the wisdom of Thy judgement.
Thou hast upheld me with certain truth;
Thou hast delighted me with Thy Holy Spirit
and [hast opened my heart] till this day.
Thy just rebuke accompanies my [faults]
and Thy safeguarding peace delivers my soul.
The abundance of (Thy) forgiveness is with my steps
and infinite mercy accompanies Thy judgement of me.
Until I am old Thou wilt care for me;
for my father knew me not
and my mother abandoned me to Thee.
For Thou art a father
to all [the sons] of Thy truth,
and as a woman who tenderly loves her babe,
so dost Thou rejoice in them;
and as a foster-father bearing a child in his lap
so carest Thou for all Thy creatures.
Hymn 19 (formerly 15)
[I thank Thee, O Lord]
XVIII (formerly X)
... and nothing exists except by Thy will;
none can consider [Thy deep secrets]
or contemplate Thy [mysteries].
What then is man that is earth,
that is shaped [from clay] and returns to the dust,
that Thou shouldst give him to understand such marvels
and make known to him the counsel of [Thy truth]?
Clay and dust that I am,

## Page 340

what can I devise unless Thou wish it,
and what contrive unless Thou desire it?
What strength shall I have
unless Thou keep me upright,
and how shall I understand
unless by (the spirit) which Thou hast shaped for me?
What can I say unless Thou open my mouth
and how can I answer unless Thou enlighten me?
Behold, Thou art Prince of gods
and King of majesties,
Lord of all spirits,
and Ruler of all creatures;
nothing is done without Thee,
and nothing is known without Thy will.
Beside Thee there is nothing,
and nothing can compare with Thee in strength;
in the presence of Thy glory there is nothing,
and Thy might is without price.
Who among Thy great and marvellous creatures
can stand in the presence of Thy glory?
How then can he who returns to his dust?
For Thy glory’s sake alone hast Thou made all these things.
Hymn 20 (formerly 16)
Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
God of mercy [and abundant] grace,
for Thou hast made known [Thy wisdom to me
that I should recount] Thy marvellous deeds,
keeping silence neither by day nor [by night]!
[For I have trusted] in Thy grace.
In Thy great goodness,
and in [the multitude of Thy mercies]


---

## Page 341

For I have leaned on Thy truth
[And unless] Thou rebuke,
there is no stumbling;
unless Thou foreknow it,
[there is no] scourge;
[nothing is done without] Thy [will].
[I will cling to Thy ways]
according to my knowledge [of Thy] truth;
contemplating Thy glory
I will recount Thy wonderful works,
and understanding [Thy goodness
I will lean on the] multitude of Thy mercies
and hope for Thy forgiveness.
For Thou Thyself hast shaped [my spirit]
and established me [according to Thy will];
and Thou hast not placed my support in gain,
[nor does] my [heart delight in riches];
Thou hast given me no fleshly refuge.
The might of warriors [rests] on abundant delights,
[and on plenty of corn] and wine and oil;
they pride themselves in possessions and wealth.
[But the righteous is like a] green [tree]
beside streams of water,
bringing forth leaves and multiplying its branches;
for [Thou hast chosen them
from among the children of] men
that they may all grow fat from the land.
Thou wilt give to the children of Thy truth
[unending joy and] everlasting [gladness],
and according to the measure of their knowledge,
so shall they be honoured one more than another.
And likewise for the son of man ...

## Page 342

in the knowledge of Thy truth,
and according to the measure of his knowledge,

[For the soul] of Thy servant has loathed [riches] and gain,

My heart rejoices in Thy Covenant

I shall flower [like the lily]
and my heart shall be open to the everlasting fountain;

But...

My heart is stricken with terror,

I thank Thee, my God,

and mightily towards a creature of clay!

I will sing Thy mercies,
and on Thy might I will meditate all day long.
I will bless Thy Name evermore.
I will declare Thy glory in the midst of the sons of men
and my soul shall delight in Thy great goodness.
I know that Thy word is truth,
and that righteousness is in Thy hand;
that all knowledge is in Thy purpose,
and that all power is in Thy might,
and that every glory is Thine.
In Thy wrath are all chastisements,
but in Thy goodness is much forgiveness
and Thy mercy is towards the sons of Thy goodwill.
For Thou hast made known to them
the counsel of Thy truth,
and hast taught them Thy marvellous mysteries.
For the sake of Thy glory
Thou hast purified man of sin
that he may be made holy for Thee,
with no abominable uncleanness
and no guilty wickedness;
that he may be one [with] the children of Thy truth
and partake of the lot of Thy Holy Ones;
that bodies gnawed by worms may be raised from the dust
to the counsel [of Thy truth],
and that the perverse spirit (may be lifted)

Hymn 22 (formerly 18)
I thank Thee, my God!
I praise Thee, my Rock!
For Thou hast made known to me the counsel of Thy truth
[and hast taught me Thy marvellous mysteries;]
and hast revealed Thy [wonders] to me.
I have beheld {Thy marvels} (4Q427 fr. 1, i) [towards the
children]
of grace,
and I know [that] righteousness is Thine,
that in Thy mercies there is [hope for me],
but without Thy grace [destruction] without end.
But a fountain of bitter mourning opens for me,
[and my tears fall down].
Distress is not hidden from my eyes
when I think of the (evil) inclinations of man,
of his return [to dust],
{I understand and observe} (4Q427 fr. 1, iii) sin and the sorrow
of guilt.
They enter my heart and reach into my bones
to...
and to meditate in sorrowful meditation.
I will groan with the zither of lamentation
in all grief-stricken mourning and bitter complaint
until iniquity and [wickedness] are consumed
and the disease-bringing scourge is no more.
Then will I play on the zither of deliverance
and the harp of joy,
[on the tabors of prayer] and the pipe of praise
without end.

There shall be neither groaning nor complaint

Apocryphal Psalms (I)
(IIQPsa=IIQ5,4Q88)
The incomplete Psalms scroll from Cave 11 (11QPsa), published by J.
A. Sanders (DJD, IV, Oxford, 1965), contains seven non-canonical
poems interspersed among the canonical Psalms. One of these
figures as Ps. 151 in the Greek Psalter, and four further compositions
have been preserved in Syriac translation. Three previously unknown
poems and an extract from the Hebrew version of Sirach li also feature
in the Scroll.
In Ps. 151 A and B or Syriac Ps. i, the story of the election of David,
the shepherd boy, as ruler of Israel, and his victory over Goliath, are
poetically retold. Ps. 154 or Syr. Ps. ii is a sapiential hymn, the
beginning and end of which are extant only in Syriac, but 4Q448,
column A (lines 8—10) represents a few words in Hebrew
corresponding to Ps. 154, 17-20 (cf. E. and H. Eshel and A. Yardeni,
‘A Qumran Composition Containing Part of Ps. 154 ... ’, IEJ 42 (1992),
201-14). Ps. 155 or Syr. Ps. iii is an amalgam of an individual
complaint and thanksgiving. Part of it is an alphabet acrostic, i.e. the
lines begin with consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Plea for
Deliverance is an individual thanksgiving hymn, the beginning of which
is lost. The Zion Psalm, of which lines 1-3 and 8-15 are also in a
fragmentary Psalms scroll from Cave 4 (4Q88 VII-VIII), is another
alphabetic acrostic hymn praising Jerusalem. Finally, the Psalm of the
Creation is a further sapiential hymn.
A midrashic account of the poetic activities of David is inserted in
column XXVII of IIQ5, crediting him with 4,050 compositions,
subdivided into psalms, songs for the daily holocaust, songs for the


---

## Page 358

Sabbath sacrifice, songs for festivals and songs for exorcism. The
mention of fifty-two Sabbaths and the 364 days indicates that the
author envisaged the solar year of the Qumran calendar.
The figure of 4,050 should be viewed against the equally prolific
literary achievement claimed for Solomon in 1 Kings v, 12 (3,000
proverbs and 1,005 songs according to the Hebrew text;
3,000proverbs and 5,000 songs according to the Septuagint). As for
Josephus, he attributes to Solomon 1,005 books of poems and 3,000
books of parables (Antiquities VIII, 44).
Only this catalogue, written in prose, is definitely sectarian. The
psalms themselves probably belong to the second century BCE at the
latest, but they may even date to the third century BCE.
Psalm 151A
XXVIII Hallelujah. Of David, son of Jesse.
1. I was smaller than my brothers, and younger than the sons of my
father.
He made me shepherd of his flock, and a ruler over his kids.
2. My hands have made a pipe and my fingers a lyre.
I have rendered glory to the Lord; I have said so in my soul.
3. The mountains do not testify to him, and the hills do not tell (of
him).
The trees praise my words and the flocks my deeds.
4. For who can tell and speak of and recount the works of the
Lord?
God has seen all, he has heard all, and he listens to all.
5. He sent his prophet to anoint me, Samuel to magnify me.
My brothers went out to meet him, beautiful of figure, beautiful of
appearance.
6. They were tall of stature with beautiful hair, yet the Lord did not
choose them.
7. He sent and took me from behind the flock, and anointed me
with holy oil, as a prince of his people, and a ruler among the

entrances.
9 For the Most High is the Lord of Jacob, and his majesty is over

10 And a man who glorifies the Most High is accepted by him as

can the po[wer] of the sons of men do?

and he answered me; he healed the brokenness of my heart.
18. 8 I was sleepy [and I] slept; I dreamt and also [I awoke].
19. [Lord, Thou didst support me when my heart was stricken, and
I called upon the Lor]d [my saviour].

be ashamed. (Render glory for ever and ever.)

Jacob, Thine elect.
Prayer for Deliverance
XIX For no worm thanks Thee, nor a maggot recounts Thy loving-
kindness.
Only the living thank Thee, all they whose feet totter, thank Thee,
when Thou makest known to them Thy loving-kindness, and causest
them to understand Thy righteousness.
For the soul of all the living is in Thy hand; Thou hast given breath to
all flesh.
O Lord, do towards us according to Thy goodness, according to the
greatness of Thy mercies, and according to the greatness of Thy
righteous deeds.
The Lord listens to the voice of all who love his name and does not
permit his loving-kindness to depart from them.

me to Sheol.
But Thou didst save me, O Lord, according to the greatness of Thy
mercies, according to the greatness of Thy righteous deeds.
I, too, have loved Thy name, and have taken refuge in Thy shadow.
When I remember Thy power, my heart is strengthened and I rely on

Your sons shall rejoice within you,
and your cherished ones shall be joined to you.
How much they have hoped in your salvation,
and how much your perfect ones have mourned for you?
Your hope, O Zion, shall not perish,
and your expectation will not be forgotten.
Is there a just man who has perished?
Is there a man who has escaped his iniquity?
Man is tried according to his way,
each is repaid according to his deeds.
Your oppressors shall be cut off from around you, O Zion,
and all who hate you shall be dispersed.
Your praise is pleasing, O Zion;
it rises up in all the world.
Many times I will remember you for a blessing;
I will bless you with all my heart.
You shall attain to eternal righteousness,
and shall receive blessings from the noble.
Take the vision which speaks of you,
and the dreams of the prophets requested for you.
Be exalted and increase, O Zion;
Praise the Most High, your Redeemer!
May my soul rejoice in your glory!
Hymn to the Creator
XXVI The Lord is great and holy, the Most Holy for generation after

righteousness are the pedestal of his throne.
He divides light from obscurity; he establishes the dawn by the
knowledge of his heart.
When all his angels saw it, they sang, for he showed them that which
they had not known.
He crowns the mountains with fruit, with good food for all the living.
Blessed be the master of the earth with his power, who establishes
the world by his wisdom.
By his understanding he stretched out the heaven, and brought forth
[wind] from his st[ores].
He made [lightnings for the rai]n, and raised mist from the end [of the
earth].
An Account of David’s Poems
XXVII David son of Jesse was wise and brilliant like the light of the
sun; (he was) a scribe, intelligent and perfect in all his ways before
God and men.
YHWH gave him an intelligent and brilliant spirit, and he wrote 3,600
psalms and 364 songs to sing before the altar for the daily perpetual
sacrifice, for all the days of the year; and 52 songs for the Sabbath
offerings; and 30 songs for the New Moons, for Feast-days and for the
Day of Atonement.
In all, the songs which he uttered were 446, and 4 songs to make
music on behalf of those stricken (by evil spirits).
In all, they were 4,050.
All these he uttered through prophecy which was given him from
before the Most High.

Apocryphal Psalms (II)
(4Q88)
The last four columns (VII- x) of a fragmentary Psalms manuscript from
Cave 4 have preserved three apocryphal poems. The first of these
(cols. vii-viii) is identical with 11Q5 XXII already presented (pp. 311-
12). Of the other two, the first (col. ix) focuses on the final judgement
and the second (col. x) is a hymn to Judah.
For the editio princeps, see P. W. Skehan et al., DJD, XVI, 102-6.

Apocryphal Psalms (III)
(11QapPsa=11Q11)
Badly worn remains of five columns of a Scroll with apocryphal psalms,
at least partly devoted to exorcism, have survived in Cave 11. Most of
the columns are so poorly preserved that no continuous reading is
possible. In col. I, where the name of Solomon implies that this was
one of the poems attributed to him, the repeated use of the term
‘demons’ and mention of ‘healing’ suggest the genre of the
composition. In col. III a ‘powerful angel’ is mentioned who seems to be
charged with defeating the demon and casting it to the ‘great abyss’
and the ‘nethermost [hell]’. Col. v, 3—13 has been recognized as the
canonical Psalm xci, preceded by small remains of the exorcistic
poem of col. IV and followed by a liturgical formula, ‘And they shall
an[swer, Amen, amen.] Selah.’ All the lacunae of col. IV have been
conjecturally filled by E. Puech in a French rendering. His presentation
will be reproduced here in English; it provides a possible general
understanding of the text, but with no guarantee that any of the restored
details is correct.

Non-canonical Psalms
(4Q380-81)
Two poorly preserved manuscripts, the first consisting of seven and
the second of 110 fragments, contain apocryphal Hebrew religious
poetry resembling biblical Psalms more than the Hodayot (1QH) from
Qumran. Some of them reuse and combine canonical Psalms (e.g. fr.
15 re-employing Pss. lxxxvi and lxxxix, and fr. 24, Ps. xviii). Not one
single line has survived intact and only a few of these largely mediocre
poems can be translated. Their editor, Eileen Schuller, assigns the
collection to the Persian-Hellenistic era and considers it to be a pre-
sectarian composition. Palaeographically the manuscript is dated to
the first half of the first century BCE. No historical allusions are
included. Like many of the biblical Psalms, these poems bore titles,
three of which have been preserved: ‘Psalm of Obadiah’ (4Q380 1 11,
8); ‘Hymn of the Man of God’ (4Q381 24, 4) and ‘Prayer of Manasseh,
King of Judah when the King of Assyria imprisoned him’ (4Q381 33,
8). The attributions are no doubt pseudepigraphic. Whether Obadiah
is the minor prophet or the court official mentioned in 1 Kings xviii, 3
cannot be decided.
For the editio princeps, see Eileen Schuller, DJD, XI, 75-172.

Lamentations
(4Q]179,4Q501)
Several fragments of a poem inspired by the biblical Book of
Lamentations have been preserved in Cave 4 (4Q179). Only fragment
2 offers a text long enough for intelligible translation. See J. M. Allegro
and A. A. Anderson, DJD, V, 75-7; cf. J. Strugnell, RQ 7 (1970), 250-
52. A second work of a similar nature (4Q501) has appeared in M.
Baillet, DJD, VII, 79-80. Both texts are dated to the second half of the
first century BCE.

Songs for the Holocaust of the Sabbath
(4Q400—407, 11Q17, Masada 1039-200)
Fragments of a document concerned with heavenly worship were first
published by J. Strugnell under the title ‘The Angelic Liturgy’, Congress
Volume Oxford, Supplements to Vetus Testamentum, VII (Leiden,
1960), 318-45. The full material, viz. eight very damaged manuscripts
from Cave 4 (4Q400-407), small fragments from Cave 11 (11Q17)
and a large fragment from Masada (1039-200), was subsequently
edited by Carol Newsom in DJD, XI, 173-401. For 11Q17 see F.
García Martinez et al., DJD, XXIII, 259-304.
From the point of view of palaeography all the manuscripts are
dated to the first century BCE, with the exception of the Masada
fragment, which belongs to the first half of the first century CE. The
songs contain angelic praises of God assigned to the first thirteen
sabbaths, i.e. the first quarter of the solar year. They imply the
simultaneity of heavenly and earthly worship. Although often obscure,
the poems depict the celestial sanctuary, the throne-chariot, and the
various groups participating in the angelic liturgy; they also include the
words of the benedictions sung by the seven archangels.
The main source of inspiration is the Book of Ezekiel, especially
chapters i and x in connection with the throne-chariot and xl-xlviii for the
heavenly sanctuary.
The songs include nothing that can be dated. On the basis of the
script and on general grounds the composition is said to belong to the
first century BCE.
The Merkabah, or divine throne-chariot, was a central subject in
ancient and medieval Jewish esotericism and mysticism. Hence this
early post-biblical manifestation of the speculation is of considerable
historical importance for the study of the so-called Merkabahmysticism
and of the Hekhaloth (‘heavenly palaces’) literature. It is noteworthy


---

## Page 382

that the Mishnah prohibits the use of Ezekiel’s passage about the
chariot as a prophetic reading in synagogue (Megillah IV, 10) or even
its discussion in private, unless with a sage already familiar with the
subject (Hagigah 11, 1).
The presence of this Qumran document in the fortress of Masada is
best explained by assuming either that a number of Essenes joined
the revolutionaries and took with them some of their manuscripts, or
that the rebels occupied the Qumran area after its evacuation by the
Community and later transferred some Essene manuscripts to their
final place of resistance.

Poetic Fragments on Jerusalem and ‘King’
Jonathan
(4Q448 )
Written in a very difficult semi-cursive script, this text has been
brilliantly deciphered by Ada Yardeni and edited by Esther and Hanan
Eshel.
The top part of the fragment, or column A, preserving the first two or
three words of ten lines, is an unknown Halleluiah psalm. However, the
last three lines have been identified by E. Eshel, as well as by M.
Kister, as belonging to the last verses of Psalm 154, included in the
Psalms Scroll from 11Q, and partly reconstructed from the Syriac (cf.
J. A. Sanders, DJD, IV, col. XVIII, lines 14-16), and ending with an
allusion to God’s presence in Zion-Jerusalem (cf. p. 307).
Column B, with its nine lines, is complete. It opens with a reference
to the ‘Holy City’, associated with ‘King’ Jonathan, but the main theme
appears to be a blessing of God’s kingdom and name on behalf of the
entire people of Israel. Note that Column A also ends with a mention of
Zion-Jerusalem.
Column C, with the second half of each of its nine lines missing, also
mentions Israel, together with God’s name and kingdom, as well as
what seems to be ‘the day of war’. The editors believe that they can
read ‘Jonathan’ in line 8, but this is far from certain.
4Q448 is a unique and significant Qumran text of historical
importance. The editors assume that King Jonathan is Alexander
Jannaeus or Yannai, i.e. a Hasmonaean ruler who, as a general rule, is
presumed by scholars to have been hostile to the Qumran Community.
They conjecture, therefore, that 4Q448 is not a sectarian composition. I
prefer, by contrast, to identify ‘King’ Jonathan as Jonathan
Maccabaeus at the start of his political-military career, when he was
celebrated as the liberator of the Jews and of Jerusalem, and link this


---

## Page 394

text to the statement of the Habakkuk Commentary in VIII, 8-9,
concerning the good behaviour ‘when he first arose’ of the ruler who
was to become the Wicked Priest. The identification of ‘King
Jonathan’ with Jonathan Maccabaeus proposed by me is shared also
by E. Puech. The name ‘Jonathan’ appears without context on a badly
damaged fragment designated 4Q523; see E. Puech, DJD, XXV, 75-
83. The script is dated to 150-125 BCE, which would suggest that the
person in question is the Maccabee brother rather than Alexander
Jannaeus (103-76 BCE).
For the editio princeps, see Esther Eshel, Hanan Eshel and Ada
Yardeni, DJD, XI, 403-25; see also G. Vermes, ‘The So-called King
Jonathan Fragment (4Q448)’, JJS 44 (1993), 294-300.

Hymn of Glorification A and B
(4Q491, fr. 11—4Q471b)
Two different versions of the same poem have been preserved. The
first was originally thought to be part of the War Scroll (Ma, 4Q491, fr.
11) and was identified as ‘The Song of Michael and the Just’ by its
editor, M. Baillet. The editor of the second text, Esther Eshel, proposes
the more likely interpretation that the speaker of the hymn is the
eschatological high priest, first humiliated by his opponents before
sharing the glory of the ‘gods’ or ‘holy ones’. The troubled career of the
last priest is also alluded to in the Aramaic Testament of Levi (4Q541,
fr. 9).
For the editio princeps, see M. Baillet, DJD, VII, 26-30 (4Q491) and
E. Eshel, DJD,XXI, 421-32 (4Q471b).

Calendars of Priestly Courses
(4Q320-30, 337)
Twelve fragmentary manuscripts from Cave 4, palaeographically dated
to the late second century BCE, present in various forms the peculiar
‘solar’ calendar - constructed in six-year sequences - of the Qumran
Community. Their year consisted of twelve months of thirty days each,
plus four extra days added to each of the four seasons (cf. above, pp.
78-9). Some documents from 4Q (320 and 321) attempt to combine
this calendar with the various priestly courses which served in turn in
the Temple for a week at a time from one sabbath to the following
Friday. They also combine it with the dates of the full moon given
according to the days of the week of duty of the priestly course, the
date of the solar month and the equivalent date of the lunar calendar of
mainstream Judaism (a year of twelve months of 29 or 30 days = 354
days). E.g. (The full moon falls): ‘On the 5th (day) in the week of
Jedaiah, corresponding to the 29th day of the lunar month, which falls
on the 30th day of the 1st solar month.’ 4Q321 records in addition the
occurrence of the New Moon. E.g. ‘And the New Moon is on the third
day in the week of Mijamin which is on the twelfth day in the eighth
month.’ An alternative interpretation suggests that the term in question
(duqah) designates the day after the full moon. 4Q321a is very
fragmentary, but it seems almost identical to 4Q321.
For the editio princeps, see S. Talmon with J. Ben-Dov, DJD, XXI,
1-156.
The following table will help readers understand the relationship
between the priestly courses on weekly duty, the ‘solar’ dates, the
moon’s phases and the feast-days falling in the month in question.

of 4QSe (4Q259). Whether it was part of the original composition is as
debatable as the attachment of a calendar to MMT at 4Q394 1-2 (cf.
above, pp. 222-3).
4Q319 represents a calendrical system based on the weekly
rotation of the twenty-four priestly courses during a six-year period and
constructed into six consecutive Jubilees, i.e. 294 years. The ‘sign’
which recurs in every three years probably identifies the years in which
the shorter lunar year of 354 days is supplemented by means of the
intercalation of an extra month of 30 days (3×354+30=1,092) to equal
the length of three ‘solar’ years of 364 days each (3×364=1,092).
Palaeographically the manuscript is dated to the first half of the first
century BCE.

‘Horoscopes’ or Astrological Physiognomies
(4Q186, 4Q534, 4Q561)
Three documents from Cave 4, one in Hebrew and two in Aramaic, all
dating probably to the end of the first century BCE, contain fragments
of ‘horoscopes’ or, more precisely, astrological physiognomies
claiming a correspondence between the features and destiny of a
person and the configuration of the stars at the time of his birth.
The Hebrew text, published by J. M. Allegro (4Q186), is written in a
childish cipher. The text runs from left to right instead of the normal
right to left and uses, in addition to the current ‘square’ Hebrew
alphabet, letters borrowed from the archaic Hebrew (or Phoenician)
and Greek scripts. The spiritual qualities of three individuals described
in the work are reflected in their share of Light and Darkness. The first
man is very wicked: eight parts of Darkness to a single part of Light.
The second man is largely good: six parts of Light against three parts
of Darkness. The last is almost perfect: eight portions of Light and only
one of Darkness.
As far as physical characteristics are concerned, shortness, fatness
and irregularity of features are associated with wickedness, their
opposites reflect virtue.
In the astrological terminology of the document, the ‘second Column’
doubtless means the ‘second House’; and a birthday ’in the foot of the
Bull’ should probably be interpreted as the presence, at that moment,
of the sun in the lower part of the constellation Taurus.
The first Aramaic ‘horoscope’ (4Q534) is, according to J. Starcky,
that of the final Prince of the Congregation, or Royal Messiah. It is just
as likely, however, that the text alludes to the miraculous birth of Noah
and it has therefore been placed together with the other remains of
Noah literature (cf. pp. 554-5below). 4Q561, also in Aramaic, is too
short to allow an identification but it is unlikely to refer to Noah as the

qualities seem to be in some middle position between good and evil.
Whether the sectaries forecast the future by means of astrology, or
merely used horoscope-like compositions as literary devices, is
impossible to decide at present, though I am inclined towards the latter
alternative. That such texts are found among the Scrolls should not,
however, surprise anyone. For if many Jews frowned on astrology,
others, such as the Hellenistic Jewish writer Eupolemus, credited its
invention to Abraham! (Cf. G. Vermes, Scripture and Tradition in
Judaism,Leiden, 1973, 80-82.)

Phases of the Moon
(4Q317)
Seventy-six fragments of an astronomical text written in a cryptic
alphabet record the phases of the moon, divided into 1/14ths of the full
size of the moon, over the consecutive days of a 364-day solar
calendar. J. T. Milik has reconstructed a fourteen-line section, based
on fr. 1 ii, 2—14 and supplemented with other smaller fragments.
For the text, see J. T. Milik, The Books of Enoch: Aramaic
Fragments of Qumran Cave 4 (Oxford, 1976), 68-9.

A Zodiacal Calendar with a Brontologion
(4Q318)
A fascinating, but unfortunately fragmentary, calendar indicates the
passage of the moon through the various Zodiacal signs during the
successive months of the year from Nisan to Adar. The fragment
begins with the month of Tevet, continues with Tishri and ends with
Adar. The last four lines of col. VIII have preserved a brontologion, i.e.
prediction of prodigies or ill-omens by means of an interpretation of
the sound of thunder on certain specified days of the month. The actual
prediction of woe survives only at the end of the text in lines 8-9. It
takes the form of a famine and the invasion of the country by a
conquering foreign army.

Order of Divine Office
(4Q334)
Cave 4 has yielded seven fragments of a liturgical work made up of six
columns, listing the number of songs and words of praise to be sung
during the night and during the day on consecutive days of the month.
Only frs. 2-4 can be built up into a coherent text. The script is dated to
the end of the first century BCE.

The Words of the Heavenly Lights
(4Q504—6)
Surviving in three fragmentary manuscripts from Cave 4 (4Q504-6),
‘The Words of the Heavenly Lights’ are collective prayers for the days
of the week which are full of biblical reminiscences. In the best-
preserved of them (4Q504), the Sabbath and the fourth day are
expressly mentioned in the surviving text. The editor of the document,
M. Baillet (DJD, VII (1982), 137-75), attributes to it an exaggeratedly
early date, the mid-second century BCE.
4Q504
I ... Amen! Amen! ... II ... We pray Thee, O Lord, do in accordance with
Thyself, in accordance with the greatness of Thy might, Thou who didst
pardon our fathers when they rebelled against Thy saying. Thou wert
angry with them so as to wish to destroy them, but because of Thy love
for them and for the sake of Thy Covenant - for Moses had atoned for
their sin - and in order that Thy great might and the abundance of Thy
mercy might be known to everlasting generations, Thou didst take pity
on them. So let Thine anger and wrath against all [their] sin turn away
from Thy people Israel. Remember Thy marvels which Thou didst for
the poor of the nations. For we were called by Thy Name... to [cause]
us [to repent] with all (our) heart and soul and to plant Thy Law in our
heart [that we might never depart from it, straying neither] to right nor to
left. For Thou wilt heal us of foolishness and of blindness and confusion
[of heart... Behold] we were sold because of our iniquities but despite
our offences Thou didst call us ... Thou wilt save us from sinning
against Thee ... and to make us understand the testimonies ...

III ... Behold, all the nations are as nothing beside Thee, they are
counted as void and naught before Thee. We have called on Thy
Name alone. Thou hast created us for Thy glory and made us Thy
children in the sight of all the nations. For Thou hast named Israel ‘My
son, my first-born’, and hast chastised us as a man chastises his son.
Thou hast brought us up throughout the years of our generations [by
means of] evil diseases, famine, thirst, pestilence, and the sword ... of
Thy Covenant. Because Thou hast chosen us [from all] the earth [to be
Thy people,] therefore hast Thou poured out Thine anger [and jealousy]
upon us in all the fury of Thy wrath. Thou hast caused [the scourge] of
Thy [plagues] to cleave to us of which Moses wrote, and Thy servants
the Prophets, that Thou wouldst send evil against us in the last days...
IV ... Thy dwelling-place ... a resting-place in Jerus[alem, the city
which] Thou hast [chosen] from all the earth that Thy [Name] might
remain there for ever. For Thou hast loved Israel above all the peoples.
Thou hast chosen the tribe of Judah and hast established Thy
Covenant with David that he might be as a princely shepherd over Thy
people and sit before Thee on the throne of Israel for ever. All the
nations have seen Thy glory, Thou who hast sanctified Thyself in the
midst of Thy people Israel. They brought their offering to Thy great
Name, silver and gold and precious stones together with all the
treasures of their lands, that they might glorify Thy people, and Zion Thy
holy city, and the House of Thy majesty. And there was neither
adversary nor misfortune, but peace and blessing... and they ate and
were satisfied and grew fat ...
V ... [they forsook] the fount of living waters... and served a strange
god in their land. Also, their land was ravaged by their enemies; for Thy
fury and the heat of Thy wrath overflowed, in the fire of Thy jealousy,
making of it a desert where no man could go and return. Yet
notwithstanding all this, Thou didst not reject the seed of Jacob, neither
didst Thou cast away Israel to destruction, breaking Thy Covenant with
them. For Thou alone art a living God and there is none beside Thee.
Thou didst remember Thy Covenant, Thou who didst rescue us in the
presence of all the nations, and didst not forsake us amid the nations.
Thou wert gracious towards Thy people Israel in all the lands to which
Thou didst banish them, that they might remember to return to Thee

and to hearken to Thy voice [according to] all Thou hadst commanded
by the hand of Moses Thy servant.
For Thou hast shed Thy Holy Spirit upon us, bringing upon us Thy
blessings, that we might seek Thee in our distress [and whis]per
(prayers) in the ordeal of Thy chastisement. We have entered into
distress, have been [stri]cken and tried by the fury of the oppressor.
For we also have tired God with our iniquity, we have wearied the
Rock with [our] sins. [But] in order that we may profit, Thou hast not
wearied us who leadest [us] in the way in [which we must walk. But] we
have not heeded ...
VI ... [Thou hast taken away] all our transgressions and hast purified
us of our sin for Thine own sake. Thine, Thine is righteousness, O
Lord, for it is Thou who hast done all this! Now, on the day when our
heart is humbled, we expiate our iniquity and the iniquity of our fathers,
together with our unfaithfulness and rebellion. We have not rejected
Thy trials and scourges; our soul has not despised them to the point of
breaking Thy Covenant despite all the distress of our soul. For Thou,
who hast sent our enemies against us, strengthenest our heart that we
may recount Thy mighty deeds to everlasting generations. We pray
Thee, O Lord, since Thou workest marvels from everlasting to
everlasting, to let Thine anger and wrath retreat from us. Look on [our
affliction] and trouble and distress, and deliver Thy people Israel [from
all] the lands, near and far, [to which Thou hast banished them], every

Liturgical Prayer
(1Q 34 and 34 bis)
The following fragments, published by J. T. Milik (DJD, I, 152-5),
belong to a collection of prayers for Jewish festivals. The title of the
present section is lost, but reference to the renewal of the Covenant
seems to indicate that we have here another part of the sect’s
Pentecostal liturgy.
I ... Thou wilt cause the wicked to be our ransom and the unfaithful to
be our redemption. [Thou wilt] blot out all our oppressors and we shall
praise Thy Name for ever [and ever]. For this hast Thou created us and
[to say to Thee] this: Blessed art Thou ...
II ... the Great Light (of heaven) for the [day]time, [and the Little Light
(of heaven) for the night] ... without transgressing their laws, ... and their
dominion is over all the world.
But the seed of man did not understand all that Thou caused them to
inherit; they did not discern Thee in all Thy words and wickedly turned
aside from every one. They heeded not Thy great power and therefore
Thou didst reject them. For wickedness pleases Thee not, and the
ungodly shall not be established before Thee.
But in the time of Thy goodwill Thou didst choose for Thyself a
people. Thou didst remember Thy Covenant and [granted] that they
should be set apart for Thyself from among all the peoples as a holy
thing. And Thou didst renew for them Thy Covenant (founded) on a
glorious vision and the words of Thy Holy [Spirit], on the works of Thy
hands and the writing of Thy Right Hand, that they might know the
foundations of glory and the steps towards eternity... [Thou didst raise
up] for them a faithful shepherd ...

Prayers for Festivals
(4Q 507-9)
Three badly worn manuscripts from Cave 4 (4Q507-9) partly
correspond to the foregoing fragments from Cave 1 (1Q34 and 34
bis). They have preserved prayers for festivals, two of which are
explicitly associated with the Day of Atonement and the Day of
Firstfruits. The editor, M. Baillet (DJD, VII, 175-215), dates them to the
beginning of the first century CE.

breast by guilt. While we live, we walk in iniquity...

Daily Prayers
(4Q 503)
A manuscript from Cave 4 (4Q503) consisting of 225 papyrus
fragments, edited by M. Baillet (DJD, VII, 105-36), lists evening and
morning benedictions for each day of the month. The calendar followed
appears to be lunar since evening precedes morning. The editor
places the writing in the first quarter of the first century BCE.
III And when the sun rises... the firmament of heaven, they shall bless.
Answer[ing they shall say:] Blessed be the Go[d of Israel ... ] Today... in
the fourt[h of the gates of light... ] On the fifth [of the month in the
eve]ning, they shall bless. Answering, they shall say: Blessed be the
God [of Israel] who hides... before him in every division of his glory...

Prayer or Hymn Celebrating the Morning and the
Evening
(4Q 408)
One medium sized and fifteen or sixteen small fragments represent a
collection of liturgical prayers of which only one can be partly
translated. The document is akin to 4Q375 and 376 as well as to
1Q29. Palaeographically the document is placed in the late second
century BCE.
For the editio princeps, see Annette Steudel, DJD, XXXVI, 298-
319.
Fr. I

dominion of the light as the boundary of the daytime ... for their work.
To bless Thy holy name Thou hast created them. For the light is good
... [Thou art ... ] who hast created the evening as a sign to reveal the
dominion [of darkness] ... from labour. Thou hast [c]reated them to
bless Thy holy name] when they see that the light is good and when ...
Thou hast created the evening as a sign (to mark) the appearance of
the dominion of [darkness] ...

Blessings
(1QSb=1Q28b)
These fragments from a collection of blessings were originally
attached to the Scroll containing the Community Rule and the
Messianic Rule. They have been skilfully pieced together by J. T. Milik
(DJD, I, 118-29), who dates them to around 100 BCE.
The Blessings were to be recited by the Master or Guardian, and
were, as it seems, intended for the messianic age, and perhaps for the
ceremony of the institution of the new Community. It is, however,
possible that they were actually used during the course of some liturgy
anticipating and symbolizing the coming of the messianic era. All the
members of the Covenant are blessed first, followed by someone who
seems to be the priestly head of the Community, the Messiah of
Aaron. The next blessing is addressed to the sons of Zadok, the
Priests (and Levites?), and finally the Prince of the Congregation, the
Messiah of Israel, is blessed. The rest of the document is lost.
For an additional fragment, see G. J. Brooke and J. M. Robinson, ‘A
Further Fragment of iQSb: The Schøyen Collection MS 1909’, JJS 46
(1995), 120-33.
The Blessing of the Faithful
I Words of blessing. The Master shall bless them that fear [God and

Benedictions
(4Q 280, 286-90)
Five fragmentary copies of a text containing liturgical blessings and
curses, each unit ending with ‘Amen, amen’, have survived in Cave 4.
Of these 4QBerakhota (4Q286), preserved on three photographic
plates (PAM 43-311-13), provides continuous passages. They parallel
Community Rule II and War Rule XIII, and the style of 4Q286 I also
recalls the Songs of the Holocaust for the Sabbath (4Q400-407). I
agree with Bilhah Nitzan that 4QBerakhot is probably an independent
version of part of the ceremony of the renewal of the covenant included
in 1QS 11, 3-17. 4Q280 depends mainly on Community Rule ii, but
reveals Satan’s specific name, Melkiresha’ (My king is wickedness),
the counterpart of Melchizedek (My king is justice), chief of the Army of
Light (cf. below, pp. 532, 571).
For the editio princeps, see B. Nitzan, DJD, XI, 1-74 (4Q286-90),
and DJD, XXIX, 1-8 (4Q280).

Confession Ritual
(4Q393)
Fragmentary remains of a communal confession of sins, spoken in the
first person plural, recall the language of Psalm li, Jeremiah and
Deuteronomy, and resemble confession prayers in Ezra ix, 5-15;
Daniel ix, 4-19; 1QS 1, 24-11, 1. In the latter text, the parallel
confession is part of the ceremony of the renewal of the Covenant. The
script is dated to mid-first century BCE.
For the editio princeps, see Daniel Falk, DJD, XXIX, 45-61.

Purification Ritual A
(4Q 512)
Badly worn papyrus fragments from Cave 4 (4Q512) contain prayers:
to be recited to obtain purification from various kinds of ritual
uncleanness. M. Baillet (DJD, VII, 263-86) suggests an early first-
century BCE date for the script.
Frs. 29-32

Thirty-six badly damaged fragments, written on the verso of 4Q415,

Apocalyptic Chronology or Apocryphal Weeks
(4Q 247)
A fragment consisting of seven mutilated lines, and palaeographically
dated to the last decades of the first century BCE, appears to belong
to an apocalyptic account of world history, divided into weeks of years
and possibly centred on the Temple of Jerusalem. Despite the lack of
continuous narration, the significant details justify the inclusion of this
text in the volume.

Aemilius (no doubt M. Aemilius Scaurus, governor of Syria). They all

Historical Text F
(4Q468e)
A tiny fragment is the only surviving part of a historical document
containing the unusual name of Pwtl‘ys. The editor, M. Broshi, reads it
as Ptollas, a Hellenized form of the Hebrew name Putiel, and probably
identical with a companion of Herod’s son Archelaus, who
accompanied him to Rome in 4 BCE. The journey was preceded by
civil riots in Jerusalem which were suppressed by the army, killing
three thousand people (cf. Josephus, Ant. xvii, 213-18; War ii, 8-14)’
Two other scholars, D. R. Schwartz and W. Horbury (see JJS 50, 308-
11), suggest a reading of Peitholaus, a pro-Roman Jew associated
with the massacre of many of his compatriots in mid-first century BCE
(cf. Ant. xiv, 84-5; War, i, 162-3).

The Triumph of Righteousness or Mysteries
(1Q27, 4Q299-3011)
Originally entitled The Book of Mysteries by J. T. Milik (DJD, I, 102-5),
these fragments expound the familiar theme of the struggle between
good and evil, but their nature is difficult to determine. Perhaps they
derive from a sermon, or from an apocalyptical writing. Three further
manuscripts (4Q299-301) yield badly damaged fragments belonging
to the same writing. 4Q300 3 and 4Q299 partly overlap with 1Q27. An
earlier passage may be reconstructed from 4Q300 and 4Q299.

And this shall be the sign for you that these things shall come to
pass.
When the breed of iniquity is shut up, wickedness shall then be
banished by righteousness as darkness is banished by the light. As
smoke clears and is no more, so shall wickedness perish for ever and
righteousness be revealed like a sun governing the world. All who
cleave to the mysteries of sin shall be no more; knowledge shall fill the
world and folly shall exist no longer.

This word shall surely come to pass; this prophecy is true. And by
this may it be known to you that it shall not be taken back.
Do not all the peoples loathe iniquity? And yet it is spread by them
all. Does not the fame of truth issue from the mouth of all the nations?
Yet is there a lip or tongue which holds to it? Which nation likes to be
oppressed by another stronger than itself, or likes its wealth to be
wickedly seized? And yet which nation has not oppressed another,
and where is there a people which has not seized [another]’s wealth?

Time of Righteousness
(4Q 215a)
Previously classified as part of the Testament of Naphtali (4Q215), the

A Messianic Apocalypse
(4Q521)
Commonly referred to as the ‘Resurrection fragment’, this writing
consists of sixteen fragments. The script is dated to the beginning of
the first century BCE. Whether the designation ‘apocalypse’ is fully
justified is a moot point: the writing comes across as a composition in
verse akin to the poetry of the late biblical period. The surviving
fragments do not appear to include anything patently sectarian. The
term ‘Messiah’, probably in the singular, is used without the addition of
Aaron or Israel, and the noun ‘hasidim’, absent from the big scrolls and
little attested elsewhere, figures in lines 5 and 7. The divine name
‘Lord’ represents, not the Tetragram, but Adonai (four times). The
poem incorporates Ps. cxlvi, 6-7 and Isa. lxi, 1, the latter cited also in
the New Testament (Lk. iv, 18). As in the Gospels, healing and
resurrection are linked to the idea of the Kingdom of God. Line 12
furnishes the most explicit evidence concerning the raising of the
dead. Fragment 7, line 6, repeats the same idea, referring to God as
‘He who will raise the dead of His people’.
For the editio princeps, see E. Puech, DJD, XXV, 1—38; cf. G.
Vermes, ‘Qumran Forum Miscellanea I’,JJS 43 (1992), 303-4.

The Seductress
(4Q184)
A long and relatively well-preserved Wisdom poem from Cave 4
(4Q184) depicts, by means of the metaphor of the harlot, the dangers
and attraction of false doctrine. Palaeographically, the text is dated to
the first century BCE, but the work may be much older, possibly
antedating the Qumran sect.
For the editio princeps, see J. M. Allegro and A. A. Anderson,
DJD,V, 82-5. Cf. also J. Strugnell, RQ 7 (1970), 263-8.

the Pit.

doings.

She is the beginning of all the ways of iniquity.
Woe (and) disaster to all who possess her! And desolation to
all who hold her!
For her ways are ways of death, and her paths are roads of sin,
and her tracks are pathways to iniquity, and her by-ways are
rebellious wrong-doings.
Her gates are gates of death, and from the entrance of the
house she sets out towards the underworld.
None of those who enter there will ever return, and all who
possess her will descend to the Pit. She lies in wait in secret
places, ...
In the city’s squares she veils herself, and she stands at the
gates of towns.
She will never re[st] from wh[orin]g, her eyes glance hither and
thither.
She lifts her eyelids naughtily to stare at a virtuous man and join
him, and an important man to trip him up, at upright men to
pervert their way, and the righteous elect to keep them from the
commandment, at the firmly established to bring them down
wantonly, and those who walk in uprightness to alter the statute;
to cause the humble to rebel against God, and turn their steps
away from the ways of justice, to bring insolence to their heart,
so that they march no more in the paths of uprightness; to lead
men astray to the ways of the Pit, and seduce with flatteries
every son of man.

Exhortation to Seek Wisdom
(4Q185)
Large fragments of a Wisdom poem in which a teacher encourages
his ‘people’, his ‘sons’, the ‘Simple’, to search for Wisdom have been
preserved in Cave 4 (4Q185). The script is believed to be late
Hasmonaean, i.e. from the first half of the first century BCE. As is often
the case in Wisdom literature, events of the patriarchal and Mosaic
past are used for didactic purposes.
For the editio princeps, see J. M. Allegro and A. A. Anderson, DJD,
V, 85-7. Cf. J. Strugnell, RQ 7 (1970), 269-73.
I ... And you, sons of men, woe to you!
For he (man) sprouts from his ground like grass, and his grace
blossoms like a flower.
His [gl]ory blows away and his grass dries up, and the wind
carries away its flower

They shall seek him but shall not find him, and there is no hope
(for him); and his days are like a shadow over the ea[rth].
Now pray hearken to me, my people; heed me, O you Simple;
become wise through the might of God.

marvels in the land of Ham.

A Sapiential Work (ii)
(4Q415-18, 423, 1Q26)
A substantial Wisdom composition, probably dating to the second
century BCE, has survived in six fragmentary manuscripts, one from
Cave 1 (1Q26) and five partly overlapping scrolls from Cave 4 (4Q415,
416, 417, 418a and b and 423). Apart from the last-mentioned
manuscript, dated to the first half of the first century CE, all are said to
be early Herodian (30—1 BCE). The work is unquestionably sectarian
and displays a terminology akin to the Community Rule, the Damascus
Document and the Thanksgiving Hymns. T. Elgvin has attempted to
reconstruct the original work and he sums up its contents as follows:
argument with a neighbour; relationship of the elect to God and man;
God as provider for all his creatures; business ethics; a modest life;
deposit to be returned in full; the hope of the just man; divine mysteries
to be studied and the praise of God’s name; attitude to parents, wife,
children; the elect and the sage’s escape from God’s anger; God as
permanent judge of wickedness; God as creator of the heavenly
beings and luminaries; God as future judge; mankind’s submission to
God; the fate of the just and the wicked; religious life; first-born sons of
God in praise of him; the use of insight; God’s eternal plant: the saints;
God’s providence; the distribution of the portions of the elect; the
farmer and the garden of Eden; Warning: God is to try man. Cf. T.
Elgvin, ‘The Reconstruction of Sapiential Work A’, RQ16 (1995), 559-
80.

A Sapiential Work (iii): Ways of Righteousness
(4Q420-21)
Two badly fragmented copies of a Wisdom composition portray the
behaviour of the righteous man in universal terms. However, since the
vocabulary of 4Q421 1 i echoes the terminology of the Community
Rule, the whole work may be classified as sectarian.

A Sapiential Work Instruction-like Composition
(4Q424)
The main aim of this poetic composition is to instruct the just man how
to ensure the progress of wisdom by not entrusting its propagation to
the unworthy. Palaeographically it is dated to the second half of the first
century BCE.
For the editio princeps, see S. Tanzer, DJD, XXXVI, 333-46.
Fr. 1

he too will be for contempt.
Do not send a blind man to bring a vision to the upright;

into judgement,
for he will not smooth out a quarrel between people.
Like one who scatters into the wind...

so is he who speaks to an ear which does not listen,
and talks to a man deep asleep through a spirit...
Do not send a ‘fat-hearted’ (dense) man to acquire thoughts,

and will not find wisdom for his hands.

The Two Ways
(4Q473)
Inspired by Deuteronomy xi, 26-28, this fragmentary text,
palaeographically dated to the end of the first century BCE, is akin to
the Instruction on the Two Spirits in the Community Rule (1QS 111, 13-
IV, 25).
For the editio princeps, see T. Elgvin, DJD, XXII, 289-99.
... and He has placed [before you] t[wo] ways one which is goo[d and
one which is evil. If you choose the good way], He will bless you. But if
you walk in the [evil] way, [He will curse you] ... and in your [te]nts, and
He will destroy you with ... and mildew, snow, ice and hai[l] ... with all.

Bless, My Soul
(Barki nafshia-e, 4Q434-438)
Cave 4 has yielded five manuscripts (4Q434-438) of a poetic
composition designated by the opening words of the first section as
Barki nafshi or ‘Bless, my soul’. A sixth manuscript (4Q439) is said to
be akin to it. The pieces translated are not unlike some of the
Thanksgiving Hymns, but include no sectarian features.
For the editio princeps, see M. Weinfeld and D. Seely, DID, XXIX,
255-334.
4Q434, fr. I
Bless, my soul, the Lord
for all His marvels for ever,
and may His name be blessed.
For He has delivered the soul of the poor,
and has not despised the humble,
and has not forgotten the misery of the deprived.
He has opened His eyes towards the distressed,
and has heard the cry of the fatherless,
and has turned His ears towards their crying.
He has been gracious to the humble by His great kindness,
and has opened their eyes to see His ways,
and [thei]r e[ar]s to hear His teaching.
He has circumcised the foreskin of their heart,
and has delivered them because of His kindness,
and has directed their feet towards the way.
He has not forsaken them amid the multitude of their

misery,
neither has He handed them over to the violent,
nor has He judged them together with the wicked.
[He has] not [directed] His anger against them,
neither did he annihilate them in His wrath.
While all His furious wrath was not growing weary,
He has not judged them in the fire of His ardour,
but He has judged them in the greatness of His mercy.
The judgements of His eyes were to try them,
and He has brought His many mercies among the nations,
[and from the hand of] men He has delivered them.
He has not judged them (amid) the mass of nations,
and in the midst of peoples He has not judged [them].
But He hid them in [His] ...
He has turned darkness into light before them,
and crooked places into level ground,
He has revealed to them abundance of peace and truth.
He has made their spirit by measure,
and has established their words by weight,
and has caused them to sing(?) like flutes.
He has given them a [perfect] heart,
and they have walked in the w[ay of His heart],
He has also caused them to draw near to the w[ay of his
heart].

He sent and covered them and commanded that no plague

Songs of the Sage
(4Q510-11)
Scraps of two manuscripts from Cave 4 (4Q510-11) represent a
mixture of sapiential psalms and poems of exorcism. Their editor, M.
Baillet (DJD, VII, 215-62), assigns the script to the end of the first
century BCE, or the turning of the era. The first fragment preserves an
interesting list of names of demons.

Beatitudes
(4Q525)
The title given to this piece of wisdom poetry, consisting of fifty mostly
small fragments palaeographically dated to the second half of the first
century BCE, derives from the repeated use of ‘Blessed’ (’ashre),
modelled on Ps. i, 1, and recalling the Beatitudes of the New
Testament (Matth. v, 3-11). The main structural difference between
Matthew and 4Q525 lies in that the former each time lists the reward of
the virtue for which people are blessed, whereas the Cave 4 text
provides ordinary, mostly antithetic, parallelisms instead.
For the editio princeps, see E. Puech, DJD, XXV, 115-78.
Fr. 2
II [Blessed is] ... with a pure heart
and does not slander with his tongue.
Blessed are those who hold to her (Wisdom’s) precepts
and do not hold to the ways of iniquity.
Blessed are those who rejoice in her,
and do not burst forth in ways of folly.
Blessed are those who seek her with pure hands,
and do not pursue her with a treacherous heart.
Blessed is the man who has attained Wisdom,
and walks in the Law of the Most High.
He directs his heart towards her ways,
and restrains himself by her corrections,
and always takes delight in her chastisements.
He does not forsake her when he sees distress,
nor abandon her in time of strain.
He will not forget her [on the day of] fear,

F. Bible Interpretation
‘The Targum of Job’, Israel Antiquities Authority
Introductory Note
Five types of biblical commentary have been recovered from the
Qumran caves.
The first and least developed form of exegesis is contained in the
so-called ‘Reworked Pentateuch’ texts, consisting of a quasi-
traditional text of the Bible, occasionally rearranged and
supplemented. To this category belong 4Q158, 364-7, 422, 382, etc.
The Temple Scroll (11Q19-20) may also be assigned to this group, as
well as the fairly, though not strictly, literal Aramaic translations or
Targums of the Hebrew Scriptures (4Q156-7; 11Q10), to which should


---

## Page 517

be added some small fragments of the Greek Bible from Caves 4 and
7.
The second type, represented by the Genesis Apocryphon, sets out
to render the Bible story more intelligible and attractive by giving it
more substance, by reconciling conflicting statements, and by
reinterpreting in the light of contemporary standards and beliefs any
passages which might seem to give offence. In a somewhat similar
manner, a Commentary on Genesis from Cave 4 (4Q252) attempts to
adjust the chronology of the Flood to the specific sectarian calendar of
the Qumran Community.
The third type of commentary departs from the biblical text and,
relying on one or several passages, creates a new story. Among
others, the Admonition associated with the Flood (4Q370, 185), the
Words of Moses (1Q22), the New Jerusalem texts (4Q554-5, 5Q15,
etc.) and the Prayer of Nabonidus (4Q242), inspired by Genesis,
Deuteronomy, Ezekiel and Daniel respectively, come into this
category.
The fourth and most characteristic form of exegesis applies
prophetic texts to the past, present and future of the sect. Normally the
commentator expounds a biblical book verse by verse, e.g. Isaiah
(4Q161-4); Nahum (4Q169); Habakkuk (1QpHab); the Psalms
(4Q171, 173), etc., but some works - A Midrash on the Last Days
(4Q174), The Heavenly Prince Melchizedek (11Q13), etc. - follow the
traditional Jewish example and assemble passages from different
parts of Scripture in order to develop a common theme.
Finally, a substantial amount of free compositions modelled on the
Bible, e.g. Jubilees (4Q216-28), Enoch and the Giants (4Q201-12,
530-33), or circulating together with the Bible, e.g. the Para-Danielic
fragments (4Q243-5), and works attributed to Noah (1Q19, etc.), the
Patriarchs Levi (4Q213-14, 537-41), Moses (4Q374-7, 390), and
many others constitute a fifth category of exegesis. In one way, the
Aramaic and Hebrew manuscripts of one of the Apocrypha, the Book
of Tobit (4Q196-200), pertain to this class.

Aramaic Bible Translations
(Targums)
Two books of the Hebrew Bible have survived in Aramaic translation in
the Qumran caves. A small scroll, found in Cave 11 and measuring
109 cm, has preserved in Aramaic a large portion of the last seven
chapters of the Book of Job. Twenty-seven smaller fragments cover
parts of Job xvii, 14 to xxxvi, 33. This text, together with small remains
from Cave 4 of Leviticus (4Q156=xvi, 12-21, see below) and of
another manuscript of Job (4Q157=iii, 5-9; iv, 16-v, 4), represent the
oldest extant Aramaic renderings of the Hebrew Bible. The translation
of Job frequently differs from the customary text of the Hebrew Bible,
but it is unclear whether the divergences are due merely to the difficulty
of translating poetry, or to a Hebrew original not identical with the
traditional Scripture.
Hebrew Jobxl, 12
Look on every one that is proud and bring him low; and tread
down the wicked where they stand.
11 Qar Job
And every proud spirit you will smash; and extinguish the
wicked below them.
It is clear, on the other hand, that the prose narrative of xlii, 9-11
displays notable departures from the text known to us, as may be seen
from the following parallel translations:
Hebrew Job xlii
(9) So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar
the Naamathite went and did what the Lord had told them; and


---

## Page 519

the Lord accepted Job’s prayer. (10) And the Lord restored the
11 Qar Job
(9)... God. God heard the voice of Job and forgave them (his
friends’) their sins because of him. (10) And God returned
fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends; and the
Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. (11) Then
came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known
him before, and ate bread with him in his house; and they
showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the
Lord had brought upon him; and each of them gave him a piece
of money (or: sheep) and a ring of gold. to Job with mercy and
doubled all that he had owned. (11) All his friends, brothers and
acquaintances came to Job and they ate bread with him in his
house, and they comforted him for all the misery that God had
brought on him and each gave him a ewe-lamb and a ring of
gold.
The English version provided below (Job xxxvii, 11 to xlii, 11) should
therefore be read side by side with the translation of the canonical Job.
It will be noticed that Job xxxix, 24 is missing from the Aramaic and xlii,
3 is replaced by xl, 5. Furthermore, in Job xxxviii, 7 the phrase ‘angels’
is substituted for ‘sons of God‘, a doctrinally suspect expression since
Jews rejected the idea of God having children. The same substitution
is found in the Greek Septuagint and the Targum of Job used in
rabbinic Judaism. Similarly the Targum to Lev. xvi, 14 and xvi, 20
(4Q156) specifies, as do the later Targums, that ‘the Holy’ designates
‘the House of Holiness’ or ‘Sanctuary’. In short, the Qumran Targums
prefigure to some extent the style of the later Targums without
attesting, however, the exegetical expansions which characterize the
Palestinian Targums to the Pentateuch.

Appendix
(A) GREEK BIBLE TRANSLATIONS (4Q119-22;
7Q1-2)
Compared to the quantity of Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts, the
Greek documents found in two of the Qumran caves, Caves 4 and 7,
are remarkably few, and this scarcity is significant in itself as regards
the cultural identity of the Qumran Community. Those which have been
identified with certainty belong to the Greek translation of the Bible,
mostly the Pentateuch. Cave 4 has yielded remains of two scrolls of
Leviticus, one of leather (4Q119) and one of papyrus (4Q120), as well
as one of Numbers (4Q121) and of Deuteronomy (4Q122), all dating
to the second or the first century BCE. On the whole, they represent the
traditional text of the Septuagint with minor variations such as a word
being replaced by its synonym (harvesting by threshing, for example,
or nation by people), but 4QLXX Numbers (4Q121) testifies to an
effort to bring the LXX closer to the Hebrew Pentateuch. Since the
translation scarcely differs from the original, there is no purpose in
reproducing it. However, it is worth noting that in Lev. iv, 27 (4Q120, fr.
20, 4) the Tetragram (the divine name YHWH) is rendered semi-
phonetically as Iao, and is not replaced, as was customary later, by the
Greek Kurios (Lord).
Among the nineteen minute fragments found in Cave 7 - which
contained only Greek texts - two have been identified as relics of
Exodus xxviii, 4-7 (7Q1) and the Letter of Jeremiah, verses 43-4
(7Q2). The former is said to be closer to the traditional Hebrew text
than to the LXX. Both are dated to about 100 BCE.
(B) OTHER GREEK FRAGMENTS (4Q126-7; 7Q3-


---

## Page 528

19)
The remaining two Greek texts in Cave 4 date roughly to the turn of the
era. One (4Q126) cannot be identified and the other (4Q127) is either
a paraphrase of Exodus, mentioning among others Pharaoh, Moses
and Egypt, or possibly an apocryphal account of Israel in Egypt.
Seventeen out of the nineteen minute Greek papyrus fragments from
Cave 7 have been declared by the editors to be unidentifiable. Yet
against all verisimilitude, several of them have generated sensational
and even revolutionary claims, especially that they represented the
earliest textual examples of the Greek New Testament.
The contention originated with a Spanish Jesuit, José O‘Callaghan,
who in 1972 persuaded himself that these hardly legible scraps
derived from six books of the New Testament: the Gospel of Mark iv,
28 (7Q6 1), vi, 48 (7Q15), vi, 52-3 (7Q5), xii, 17 (7Q7); the Acts of the
Apostles xxviii, 38 (7Q6 2); 1 Timothy iii, 16, iv, 1, 3 (7Q4); James i,
23-4 (7Q8) and even one of the latest New Testament writings, 2 Peter
i, 15 (7Q10). Of these, the case for Mark vi, 52-3 is purported to be the
‘strongest’. The real facts are the following. We are dealing with a
fragment on which the written area measures 3.3 x 2.3 cm. Letters
appear on four lines; these are of unknown length since both the
beginning and the end of each line are missing. An unrecognizable
trace of another letter is observed at the top of the fragment. In the
editio princeps seventeen letters are identified of which only nine are
certain. A single complete word has survived: the Greek kai = and!
The leading experts in the field, the late C. H. Roberts of Oxford and
the German Kurt Aland, unhesitatingly discarded O‘Callaghan’s theory.
Roberts jokingly told me that if he wanted to waste his time, he was
sure he would be able to ‘demonstrate’ that 7Q5 belonged to any
ancient Greek text, biblical or non-biblical. Yet this unlikely and clearly
unprovable hypothesis was revived in the 1980s by C. P. Thiede and
others, only to encounter the same fate of summary dismissal as
Father O’Callaghan’s a decade or so earlier.

7Q5 et Mc. 6, 52-53’, ibid., 102-4.
The Reworked Pentateuch (4Q158, 4Q364-7)
Five badly preserved manuscripts have been classified as reworkings
of the Pentateuch, i.e. copies of the Torah partly entailing
rearrangements of biblical passages and partly incorporating
interpretative supplements inserted into the text. The length of the
supplement varies from a few words to seven or eight lines, the most
significant example being the long, but broken, addition to the Song of
Miriam in 4Q365 6a ii, c. Judging from the surviving passages, the
original Reworked Pentateuch must have been a very substantial
document, probably the longest of all the Qumran Scrolls. All the
manuscripts may be dated on palaeographical grounds to the first
century BCE. Only those texts which contain more or less intelligible
supplements (printed in italics) are included.
For the editio princeps of the Reworked Pentateuch, see J. M.
Allegro, DJD, V, 1-6 (4Q158) and E. Tov and S. White, DJD, XIII, 187-

A Paraphrase of Genesis and Exodus (4Q422)
Nine fragments of a manuscript written in Hasmonaean characters
(first half of the first century BCE) contain a paraphrase of Gen. i-iv, vi-
ix, judging from disconnected expressions relating to the creation of
the world by God’s word, to various living creatures, the establishment
of man as ruler over the rest of beings, the prohibition against eating
from the tree of knowledge and the rebellion against God which led to
the flood. Fr. 10 refers to the throwing of Israelite boys into the Nile, the
commissioning of Moses, his vision of the burning bush, Moses’ and
Aaron’s encounter with Pharaoh and the plagues which afflicted Egypt.
The text can be arranged in three columns. Further unidentified
fragments, which are not included here, are numbered from A to T. If
the word ywsr in col. 1, line 12 actually means ‘inclination’, the phrase
‘evil inclination’ could be the earliest attestation of the rabbinic
concept.

The Genesis Apocryphon (IQapGen, IQ20)
Found in Cave 1, and partly published by N. Avigad and Y. Yadin (A
Genesis Apocryphon,Jerusalem, 1956), IQapGen is an incomplete
manuscript with twenty-two surviving columns of Aramaic text (cf. also
IQ20). Remains of a further column, ‘The Genesis Apocryphon Col.
XII’, have since been edited by J. C. Greenfield and E. Qimron
(Studies in Qumran Aramaic, Abr-Nabrain, Suppl. 3 (1992), 70-77). A
preliminary transcription and translation of the rest of the unpublished
material, deciphered with the help of advanced infra-red technology,
has been issued by M. Morgenstern, E. Qimron and D. Sinan in ‘The
Hitherto Unpublished Columns of the Genesis Apocryphon’, Abr-
Nabrain 33 (1995), 3—52.
The beginning of the manuscript is missing. But since the sheet
starting with col. v is numbered by the Hebrew letter pe, col. x by sade,
and col. XVII by qoph, i.e. the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth
letters of the Hebrew alphabet, it would seem that the surviving section


---

## Page 535

was preceded by sixteen sheets of which only the end of the last one
has been preserved (cf. M. Morgenstern, ‘A New Clue to the Original
Length of the Genesis Apocryphon’, JJS 47/2 (1996), 345—7). If so,
the story of Noah which begins the existing portion of the scroll must
have been preceded by an extensive account of the creation, Adam
and Eve, and the Genesis story up to Enoch and Noah. Columns II—V
narrate the miraculous birth of Noah (on Noah see also the minute
fragments from 1Q19 and 19bis), whose father, Lamech, suspects that
his wife has conceived by one of the fallen angels. Her denials fail to
convince him and he asks his father, Methuselah, to travel to Paradise
and obtain reassurance from his own father, Enoch. Columns VI—XV
contain Noah’s first-person account of the Flood and of his journeys.
Col. x describes Noah’s sacrifice after the Flood. Col. XI deals with the
covenant between God and Noah with a mention of a ban on eating
blood. Col. XII recounts the planting of a vineyard by Noah and his
tasting of wine. The badly damaged cols. XIII—XV contain a vision
concerning trees and its interpretation. Two further columns (XVI—
XVII) deal with the division of the earth among the sons of Noah. Col.
XVIII is completely lost. Cols. XIX—XXII, corresponding to Gen. xii—xv,
deal with Abraham’s journey to Egypt, his return to Canaan, the war
against the invading Mesopotamian kings, and the renewal to him of a
divine promise of a son. This lively and delightful narrative, largely
devoid of sectarian bias, throws valuable light on inter-Testamental
Bible interpretation. It is a mixture of Targum, Midrash, rewritten Bible
and autobiography. Most scholars assign the manuscript to the late
first century BCE or the first half of the first century CE. The
composition itself is generally thought to originate from the second
century BCE. Its relationship to the mid-second-century Book of
Jubilees is generally accepted, but views differ on whether it depends
on Jubilees or vice versa. I slightly prefer the theory that in its pre-
Qumran version the Genesis Apocryphon precedes Jubilees, which
would postulate for the former a date at least as early as the first half of
the second century BCE.
... II Behold, I thought then within my heart that conception was (due) to
the Watchers and the Holy Ones... and to the Giants... and my heart

was troubled within me because of this child. Then I, Lamech,
approached Bathenosh [my] wife in haste and said to her, ‘... by the
Most High, the Great Lord, the King of all the worlds and Ruler of the
Sons of Heaven, until you tell me all things truthfully, if... Tell me [this
truthfully] and not falsely... by the King of all the worlds until you tell me
truthfully and not falsely.’
Then Bathenosh my wife spoke to me with much heat [and] ... said,
‘O my brother, O my lord, remember my pleasure... the lying together
and my soul within its body. [And I tell you] all things truthfully.’
My heart was then greatly troubled within me, and when Bathenosh
my wife saw that my countenance had changed... Then she mastered
her anger and spoke to me saying, ‘O my lord, O my [brother,
remember] my pleasure! I swear to you by the Holy Great One, the
King of [the heavens] ... that this seed is yours and that [this]
conception is from you. This fruit was planted by you... and by no
stranger or Watcher or Son of Heaven... [Why] is your countenance
thus changed and dismayed, and why is your spirit thus distressed... I
speak to you truthfully.’
Then I, Lamech, ran to Methuselah my father, and [I told] him all
these things. [And I asked him to go to Enoch] his father for he would
surely learn all things from him. For he was beloved, and he shared the
lot [of the angels], who taught him all things. And when Methuselah
heard [my words... he went to] Enoch his father to learn all things
truthfully from him ... his will.
He went at once to Parwain and he found him there... [and] he said
to Enoch his father, ‘O my father, O my lord, to whom I... And I say to
you, lest you be angry with me because I come here...
VI [I abstained] from injustice and in the womb of her who conceived
me I searched for truth. And when I emerged from my mother’s womb, I
was planted for truth and I lived all my days in truth and walked in the
paths of eternal truth. And the Holy One (was) with me ... on my
pathways truth sped to warn me off the ... of lie which led to darkness ...
and I girded my loins with the vision of truth and wisdom... paths of
violence. vacat Then I, Noah, became a man and clung to truth and
seized... and I took Amzara, his daughter as my wife. She conceived
and bore me three sons [and daughters]. Then I took wives for my sons

behold, I give all of it to you and to your sons to eat the green things

Flood. [And] all the sons of Shem, all of them, [were Ela]m, and Ashur,
Arpachshad, Lud and Aram, and five daughters. [And the sons of Ham:
Kush and Misrai]n and Put and Canaan, and seven daughters. And the
sons of Japhet: Gomer and Magog and Media and Yavan [and Tu]bal
and Mashok and Tiras, and four daughters. [And] I began, I and all my
sons, to fill the land and I planted a big vineyard on Mount Lubar and in
the fourth year it produced wine for me ... [And] when the first festival

XIX ... And I said, ‘Thou art ...’...‘... until now you have not come to the
Holy Mountain.’
And I (Abram) departed ... and I travelled towards the south ... until I
came to Hebron [at the time when Hebron] was being built; and I dwelt
there [two years].
Now there was famine in all this land, and hearing that there was
prosperity in Egypt I went ... to the land of Egypt ... I [came to] the river
Karmon, one of the branches of the River (Nile) ... and I crossed the
seven branches of the River ... We passed through our land and
entered the land of the sons of Ham, the land of Egypt.
And on the night of our entry into Egypt, I, Abram, dreamt a dream;
[and behold], I saw in my dream a cedar tree and a palm tree ... men
came and they sought to cut down the cedar tree and to pull up its
roots, leaving the palm tree (standing) alone. But the palm tree cried
out saying, ‘Do not cut down this cedar tree, for cursed be he who shall
fell [it].’ And the cedar tree was spared because of the palm tree and
[was] not felled.
And during the night I woke from my dream, and I said to Sarai my
wife, ‘I have dreamt a dream ... [and I am] fearful [because of] this
dream.’ She said to me, ‘Tell me your dream that I may know it.’ So I


---

## Page 541

began to tell her this dream ... [the interpretation] of the dream ...‘... that
they will seek to kill me, but will spare you ... [Say to them] of me, “He is
my brother”, and because of you I shall live, and because of you my life
shall be saved ... ’
And Sarai wept that night on account of my words ...
Then we journeyed towards Zoan, I and Sarai ... by her life that none
should see her ...
And when those five years had passed, three men from among the
princes of Egypt [came at the command] of Pharaoh of Zoan to inquire
after [my] business and after my wife and they gave ... goodness,
wisdom, and truth. And I exclaimed before them ... because of the
famine ... And they came to ascertain ... with much food and drink ...
the wine ...
(During the party, the Egyptians must have seen Sarai, and on their
return they praised her to the king.)
XX ...‘... and beautiful is her face! How ... fine are the hairs of her
head! How lovely are her eyes! How desirable her nose and all the
radiance of her countenance ... How fair are her breasts and how
beautiful all her whiteness! How pleasing are her arms and how perfect
her hands, and how [desirable] all the appearance of her hands! How
fair are her palms and how long and slender are her fingers! How
comely are her feet, how perfect her thighs! No virgin or bride led into
the marriage chamber is more beautiful than she; she is fairer than all
other women. Truly, her beauty is greater than theirs. Yet together with
all this grace she possesses abundant wisdom, so that whatever she
does is perfect (?).’ When the king heard the words of Harkenosh and
his two companions, for all three spoke as with one voice, he desired
her greatly and sent out at once to take her. And seeing her, he was
amazed by all her beauty and took her to be his wife, but me he sought
to kill. Sarai said to the king, ‘He is my brother,’ that I might benefit
from her, and I, Abram, was spared because of her and I was not slain.
And I, Abram, wept aloud that night, I and my nephew Lot, because
Sarai had been taken from me by force. I prayed that night and I
begged and implored, and I said in my sorrow while my tears ran
down: ‘Blessed art Thou, O Most High God, Lord of all the worlds,
Thou who art Lord and king of all things and who rulest over all the


---

## Page 542

kings of the earth and judgest them all! I cry now before Thee, my Lord,
against Pharaoh of Zoan the king of Egypt, because of my wife who
has been taken from me by force. Judge him for me that I may see Thy
mighty hand raised against him and against all his household, and that
he may not be able to defile my wife this night (separating her) from
me, and that they may know Thee, my Lord, that Thou art Lord of all the
kings of the earth.’ And I wept and was sorrowful.
And during that night the Most High God sent a spirit to scourge him,
an evil spirit to all his household; and it scourged him and all his
household. And he was unable to approach her, and although he was
with her for two years, he knew her not.
At the end of those two years the scourges and afflictions grew
greater and more grievous upon him and all his household, so he sent
for all [the sages] of Egypt, for all the magicians, together with all the
healers of Egypt, that they might heal him and all his household of this
scourge. But not one healer or magician or sage could stay to cure
him, for the spirit scourged them all and they fled.
Then Harkenosh came to me, beseeching me to go to the king and
to pray for him and to lay my hands upon him that he might live, for the
king had dreamt a dream ... But Lot said to him, ‘Abram my uncle
cannot pray for the king while Sarai his wife is with him. Go, therefore,
and tell the king to restore his wife to her husband; then he will pray for
him and he shall live.’
When Harkenosh had heard the words of Lot, he went to the king
and said, ‘All these scourges and afflictions with which my lord the king
is scourged and afflicted are because of Sarai the wife of Abram. Let
Sarai be restored to Abram her husband, and this scourge and the
spirit of festering shall vanish from you.’
And he called me and said, ‘What have you done to me with regard
to [Sarai]? You said to me, She is my sister, whereas she is your wife;
and I took her to be my wife. Behold your wife who is with me; depart
and go hence from all the land of Egypt! And now pray for me and my
house that this evil spirit may be expelled from it.’
So I prayed [for him] ... and I laid my hands on his [head]; and the
scourge departed from him and the evil [spirit] was expelled [from him],
and he lived. And the king rose to tell me ... and the king swore an oath


---

## Page 543

to me that ... and the king gave her much [silver and gold] and much
raiment of fine linen and purple ... And Hagar also ... and he appointed
men to lead [me] out [of all the land of Egypt]. And I, Abram, departed
with very great flocks and with silver and gold, and I went up from
[Egypt] together with my nephew [Lot]. Lot had great flocks also, and
he took a wife for himself from among [the daughters of Egypt.
I pitched my camp] XXI [in] every place in which I had formerly
camped until I came to Bethel, the place where I had built an altar. And
I built a second altar and laid on it a sacrifice, and an offering to the
Most High God. And there I called on the name of the Lord of worlds
and praised the Name of God and blessed God, and I gave thanks
before God for all the riches and favours which He had bestowed on
me. For He had dealt kindly towards me and had led me back in
peace into this land. After that day, Lot departed from me on account
of the deeds of our shepherds. He went away and settled in the valley
of the Jordan, together with all his flocks; and I myself added more to
them. He kept his sheep and journeyed as far as Sodom, and he
bought a house for himself in Sodom and dwelt in it. But I dwelt on the
mountain of Bethel and it grieved me that my nephew Lot had
departed from me. And God appeared to me in a vision at night and
said to me, ‘Go to Ramath Hazor which is north of Bethel, the place
where you dwell, and lift up your eyes and look to the east and to the
west and to the south and to the north; and behold all this land which I
give to you and your seed for ever.’
The next morning, I went up to Ramath Hazor and from that high
place I beheld the land from the River of Egypt to Lebanon and Senir,
and from the Great Sea to Hauran, and all the land of Gebal as far as
Kadesh, and all the Great Desert to the east of Hauran and Senir as
far as the Euphrates. And He said to me, ‘I will give all this land to your
seed and they shall possess it for ever. And I will multiply your seed
like the dust of the earth which no man can number; neither shall any
man number your seed. Rise and go! Behold the length and breadth of
the land, for it is yours; and after you, I will give it to your seed for ever.’
And I, Abram, departed to travel about and see the land. I began my
journey at the river Gihon and travelled along the coast of the Sea until I
came to the Mountain of the Bull (Taurus). Then I travelled from the


---

## Page 544

coast of the Great Salt Sea and journeyed towards the east by the
Mountain of the Bull, across the breadth of the land, until I came to the
river Euphrates. I journeyed along the Euphrates until I came to the Red
Sea (Persian Gulf) in the east, and I travelled along the coast of the
Red Sea until I came to the tongue of the Sea of Reeds (the modern
Red Sea) which flows out from the Red Sea. Then I pursued my way in
the south until I came to the river Gihon, and returning, I came to my
house in peace and found all things prosperous there. I went to dwell at
the Oaks of Mamre, which is at Hebron, north-east of Hebron; and I
built an altar there, and laid on it a sacrifice and an oblation to the Most
High God. I ate and drank there, I and all the men of my household, and
I sent for Mamre, Ornam and Eshkol, the three Amorite brothers, my
friends, and they ate and drank with me.
Before these days, Kedorlaomer king of Elam had set out with
Amrafel king of Babylon, Ariok king of Kaptok, and Tidal king of the
nations which lie between the rivers; and they had waged war against
Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah,
Shemiabad king of Zeboim, and against the king of Bela. All these had
made ready for battle in the valley of Siddim, and the king of Elam and
the other kings with him had prevailed over the king of Sodom and his
companions and had imposed a tribute upon them.
For twelve years they had paid their tribute to the king of Elam, but in
the thirteenth year they rebelled against him. And in the fourteenth year,
the king of Elam placed himself at the head of all his allies and went up
by the Way of the Wilderness; and they smote and pillaged from the
river Euphrates onward. They smote the Refaim who were at Ashteroth
Karnaim, the Zumzamim who were at Ammon, the Emim [who were at]
Shaveh ha-Keriyyoth, and the Horites who were in the mountains of
Gebal, until they came to El Paran which is in the Wilderness. And they
returned ... at Hazazon Tamar.
The king of Sodom went out to meet them, together with the king [of
Gomorrah], the king of Admah, the king of Zeboim, and the king of
Bela, [and they fought] a battle in the valley [of Siddim] against
Kedorlaomer [king of Elam and the kings] who were with him. But the
king of Sodom was vanquished and fled, and the king of Gomorrah fell
into the pits ... [And] the king of Elam [carried off] all the riches of


---

## Page 545

Sodom and [Gomorrah] ... and they took Lot the nephew XXII of Abram
who dwelt with them in Sodom, together with all his possessions.
Now one of the shepherds of the flocks which Abram had given to
Lot escaped from captivity and came to Abram; at that time Abram
dwelt in Hebron. He told him that Lot his nephew had been taken,
together with all his possessions, but that he had not been slain and
that the kings had gone by the Way of the Great Valley (of the Jordan)
in the direction of their land, taking captives and plundering and
smiting and slaying, and that they were journeying towards the land of
Damascus.
Abram wept because of Lot his nephew. Then he braced himself; he
rose up and chose from among his servants three hundred and
eighteen fighting men trained for war, and Ornam and Eshkol and
Mamre went with him also. He pursued them until he came to Dan, and
came on them while they were camped in the valley of Dan. He fell on
them at night from four sides and during the night he slew them; he
crushed them and put them to flight, and all of them fled before him until
they came to Helbon which is north of Damascus. He rescued from
them all their captives, and all their booty and possessions. He also
delivered Lot his nephew, together with all his possessions, and he
brought back all the captives which they had taken.
When the king of Sodom learned that Abram had brought back all
the captives and all the booty, he came out to meet him; and he went to
Salem, which is Jerusalem.
Abram camped in the valley of Shaveh, which is the valley of the
king, the valley of Beth-ha-Kerem; and Melchizedek king of Salem
brought out food and drink to Abram and to all the men who were with
him. He was the Priest of the Most High God. And he blessed Abram
and said, ‘Blessed be Abram by the Most High God, Lord of heaven
and earth! And blessed be the Most High God who has delivered your
enemies into your hand!’ And Abram gave him the tithe of all the
possessions of the king of Elam and his companions.
Then the king of Sodom approached and said to Abram, ‘My lord
Abram, give me the souls which are mine, which you have delivered
from the king of Elam and taken captive, and you may have all the
possessions.’

## Page 546

Then said Abram to the king of Sodom, ‘I raise my hand this day to
the Most High God, Lord of heaven and earth! I will take nothing of
yours, not even a shoe-lace or shoe-strap, lest you say, Abram’s riches
come from my possessions! I will take nothing but that which the young
men with me have eaten already, and the portion of the three men who
have come with me. They shall decide whether they will give you their
portion.’ And Abram returned all the possessions and all the captives
and gave them to the king of Sodom; he freed all the captives from this
land who were with him, and sent them all back.
After these things, God appeared to Abram in a vision and said to
him, ‘Behold, ten years have passed since you departed from Haran.
For two years you dwelt here and you spent seven years in Egypt, and
one year has passed since you returned from Egypt. And now examine
and count all you have, and see how it has grown to be double that
which came out with you from Haran. And now do not fear, I am with
you; I am your help and your strength. I am a shield above you and a
mighty safeguard round about you. Your wealth and possessions shall
multiply greatly.’ But Abram said, ‘My Lord God, I have great wealth
and possessions but what good shall they do to me? I shall die naked;
childless shall I go hence. A child from my household shall inherit from
me. Eliezer son
... shall inherit from me.’ And He said to him, ‘He shall not be your
heir, but one who shall spring [from your body shall inherit from you].’
Genesis Commentaries (4Q252—254a)
From this non-continuous paraphrase of Genesis, four sections are
reproduced here, two of which are of sectarian inspiration. The
composition of the first fragment attempts to adapt the chronology of
the biblical Flood story to the solar calendar of the Qumran
Community. Along more general lines, it seeks also to explain certain
peculiarities of the scriptural text, e.g., why, despite Ham’s disrespect
to his father, it was not he, but his son Canaan, who was cursed by
Noah. The exegesis attested in this section is distinct from the pesber,

and resembles partly the style of the ‘rewritten Bible’ such as the
Genesis Apocryphon, and partly the ‘plain’, or peshat, interpretation of
the rabbis.
The subject of the second excerpt is the blessing of Judah, i.e. the
tribe in which David originated. The sectarian commentator (see the
mention of the ‘men of the Community’ in line 5) emphasizes that the
royal power will belong for ever to the descendants of David, thereby
implying that all non-Davidic rulers, such as the contemporary
Hasmonaean priest-kings, unlawfully occupy the throne. If so, the
composition best fits to the first half of the first century BCE. Only four
tiny fragments of 4Q253 are extant. Fr. I mentions the ark. Fr. 3, col. I
contains a citation from Mal. iii, 16—18. This is the only translatable
excerpt. Fifteen mostly insignificant scraps of 4Q254 correspond partly
to the Noah story and partly to the blessings of the Patriarchs. Only frs.
I and 5 can be translated. Fr. I, lines 2—4 overlap with 4Q252 ii, 1.6.

4Q252, fr. I (Gen. vi, 3—XV, 17)
I [In the] four hundred and eightieth year of the life of Noah came their
end (that of antediluvian mankind). And God said, My spirit shall not
abide in man for ever and their days sball be determined to be one
hundred and twenty years (Gen. vi, 3) - until the end of the Flood. And
the waters of the Flood arrived on the earth in the six hundredth year
of the life of Noah, in the second month— on the first day of the week
—on the seventeenth (of the month). On that day all the fountains of
the great deep burst forth and the windows of the heavens were
opened. And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights (vii, 11—
12) until the twenty-sixth day of the third month, the fifth day of the
week. And the waters prevailed upon the [ea]rth a hundred and fifty
days (vii, 24)—until the fourteenth day of the seventh month, the third
day of the week. And at the end of a hundred and fifty days, the waters
had abated— two days, the fourth and the fifth day, and on the sixth
day - the ark came to rest on the mountains of Hurarat (or: Turarat),

on the seventeenth day of the seventh month (viii, 3—4). And the
waters [con]tinued to abate until the [ten]th month, the first day of (the
month) - the fourth day of the week—and the tops of the mountains
appeared (viii, 5). At the end of forty days ― after the tops of the
mountains had been seen ― Noah [op]ened the window of the ark
(viii, 6) - on the tenth day of the ele[venth] month. And he sent forth the
dove to see if the waters had subsided (viii, 8), but she did not find a
resting-place and returned to him to the ark (viii, 9). He waited
an[other] seven days and again sent her forth (viii, 10). She came
back to him with a plucked olive leaf in her beak (viii, 10—11)—[this
is the twenty-]fourth [day] of the eleventh month, the first day of the
wee[k. And Noah knew that the waters had subsided] from the earth
(viii, II). At the end of another [seven days, he sent forth the dove and
it did not] return again (viii, 12)—this is the f[irst] day [of the twelfth]
month, [the first day] of the week. At the end of three [weeks after Noah
had sent forth the dov]e which did not return to him any more, the
wa[ters] dried up [from the earth and] Noah removed the covering of
the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry (viii,
13). This was the first day of the first month. [And it happened] II in the
six hundred and first year of the life of Noah, on the seventeenth day
of the second month that the earth was dry (viii, 14) - on the first day of
the week. On that day Noah went forth from the ark (viii, 18) at the end
of a full year of three hundred and sixty-four days, on the first day of the
week, on the seven[teenth] of the second month vacat on and six vacat
Noah from the ark at the appointed time of a full year vacat And Noah
awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to
him. And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a slave of slaves shall he be
to [his] bro[thers] (ix, 24—5). But he did not curse Ham but only his
son, for God had blessed the sons of Noah. And let him dwell in the
tents of Shem (ix, 27). He gave the land to Abram, his beloved. [Terah]
was one hundred and for[t]y-five years old when he went forth from Ur
of the Chaldees and came to Haran (xi, 31). Now Ab[ram was
se]venty years old and for five years Abram dwelt in Haran. And
afterwards Abram went forth to the land of Canaan. Six[ty-five years] ...

Commentaries on Isaiah (4Q 11611-5, 3Q4)
Translatable fragments of four commentaries on Isaiah were
discovered in Cave 4 (4QpIsaa—d = 4Q161—4). A fifth (4QpIsae =
4QI65) is too mutilated to be rendered into English. The first document
alludes to the defeat of the Kittim and expounds the renowned
messianic prophecy of Isa. xi. It is related to 4Q285 (cf. p. 188). The
second and the third deal with the Jewish opponents of the sect. The

fourth, relying on Isa. liv, identifies the Community as the New
Jerusalem. They may all be assigned to the first century BCE. A small
fragment from Cave 3 (3Q4) represents a commentary on Isa. i, I, but
with no continuous text.

4Q162
[For ten acres of vineyard shall produce only one bath, and a homer
of seed shall yield but one ephah] (v, 10).
Interpreted, this saying concerns the last days, the devastation of the
land by sword and famine. At the time of the Visitation of the land there
shall be Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after strong
drink, to those who linger in the evening until wine inflames them.
They have zither and harp and timbrel and flute and wine at their
feasts, but they do not regard the work of the Lord or see the deeds of
His hand. Therefore my people go into exile for want of knowledge,
and their noblemen die of hunger and their multitude is parched with
thirst. Therefore Hell has widened its gullet and opened its mouth
beyond measure, and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude go
down, her tumult and he who rejoices in her (v, 11—14).
These are the Scoffers in Jerusalem who have despised the Law of
the Lord and scorned the word of the Holy One of Israel. Therefore
the wrath of the Lord was kindled against His people. He stretched
out His hand against them and smote them; the mountains trembled
and their corpses were like sweepings in the middle of the streets.
And [His wrath] has not relented for all these things [and His hand is
stretched out still] (v, 24—5).
This is the congregation of Scoffers in Jerusalem ...

you would not. You [said], ‘No. We will flee upon horses and will ride
on swift steeds.’ Therefore your pursuers shall be speedy also. A
thousand shall flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you shall
flee [till] you are left like a flagstaff on top of a mountain and like a
signal on top of a hill. Therefore the Lord waits to be [gracious to]
you; therefore He exalts Himself to have mercy on you. For the Lord
is a God of justice. How blessed are all those who wait for him! (xxx,
15—18).
This saying, referring to the last days, concerns the congregation of
those who seek smooth things in Jerusalem ... [who despise the] Law
and do not [trust in God] ... As robbers lie in wait for a man ... they have
despised [the words of] the Law ...
O people of Zion [who live in Jerusalem, you shall weep no more.

foundations of the Council of the Community ... the congregation of His

Commentaries on Hosea (4Q166—7)
Two fragmentary manuscripts (4Q166—7) include exegeses of
Hosea. In the first, the unfaithful wife is the Jewish people led astray by
her lovers, the Gentiles. The second refers cryptically to ‘the furious
young lion’, mentioned also in the Commentary on Nahum, and to ‘the
last Priest who shall ... strike Ephraim’.
For the editio princeps, see J. M. Allegro and A. A. Anderson, DJD,
V, 31—2.
4Q166
II [She knew not that] it was I who gave her [the new wine and oil], who
lavished [upon her silver] and gold which they [used for Baal] (ii, 8).
Interpreted, this means that [they ate and] were filled, but they forgot
God who ... They cast His commandments behind them which He had
sent [by the hand of] His servants the Prophets, and they listened to
those who led them astray. They revered them, and in their blindness
they feared them as though they were gods.
Therefore I will take back my corn in its time and my wine [in its
season]. I will take away my wool and my flax lest they cover [her
nakedness]. I will uncover her shame before the eyes of [her] lovers
[and] no man shall deliver her from out of my hand (ii, 9—10).
Interpreted, this means that He smote them with hunger and
nakedness that they might be shamed and disgraced in the sight of the
nations on which they relied. They will not deliver them from their
miseries.

I will put an end to her rejoicing, [her feasts], her [new] moons, her
Sabbaths, and all her festivals (ii, II).
Interpreted, this means that [they have rejected the ruling of the Law,
and have] followed the festivals of the nations. But [their rejoicing shall
come to an end and] shall be changed into mourning. I will ravage [her
vines and her fig trees], of which she said, ‘They are my wage [which
my lovers have given me’.] I will make of them a thicket and the [wild
beasts] shall eat them ... (ii, 12).

hand to strike Ephraim ...
[I will go and come back to my place un]til they [will] feel guilty and
seek my face; in their distress they will seek me eagerly (v, 15)-Its

Commentary on Micah (1Q]14,4Q168)


---

## Page 556

Tiny fragments from Cave I (1Q14) represent an exposition of Micah.
Although the prophet’s words are intended to castigate both Samaria
and Jerusalem, the Qumran commentator interprets Samaria as
alluding to the ‘Spouter of Lies’, the enemy of the sect, but relates
Judah and Jerusalem to the Teacher of Righteousness and his
Community. Further fragments of Micah iv, 8—12 are given the title
‘Commentary on Micah (?)’, in 4Q168 (DJD, V, 36), but since neither
the word pesher, nor any interpretative material is extant, the
manuscript may be biblical.
For the editio princeps, see J. T. Milik, DJD, 1,77—80.
[All this is] for the transgression [of Jacob and for the sins of the
House of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob?] Is it not
[Samaria? And what is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?
I will make of Samaria a ruin in the fields, and of Jerusalem a
plantation of vines] (i, 5—6).
Interpreted, this concerns the Spouter of Lies [who led the] Simple
[astray].
And what is the high place of Judah? [Is it not Jerusalem?] (i, 5).
[Interpreted, this concerns] the Teacher of Righteousness who
[expounded the law to] his [Council] and to all who freely pledged
themselves to join the elect of [God to keep the Law] in the Council of
the Community, who shall be saved on the Day [of Judgement] ...
Commentary on Nahum (4Q169)
Substantial remains of a Nahum Commentary were retrieved from
Cave 4 (4Q169). They cover parts of chapters i and ii of the biblical
book, and the first fourteen verses of chapter iii. Their historical
significance has been discussed in Chapter III (pp. 55—62). It is
worthy of note that the commentator employs not only cryptograms
(Kittim, furious young lion, etc.), but the actual names of two Greek

kings (Demetrius and Antiochus). Reference to ‘the furious young lion’
as one who ‘hangs men alive’ shows that ‘hanging’, probably a
synonym for crucifixion, was practised as a form of execution. It is also
legislated for in the Temple Scroll (LXIV, 6—13), where it is the capital
punishment reserved for traitors. In biblical law, by contrast, only the
dead body of an executed criminal is to be hanged, that is, displayed
in public as an example (Deut. xxi, 21).
On palaeographical grounds the manuscript is dated to the second
half of the first century BCE.

Whither the lion goes, there is the lion’s cub, [with none to disturb it]

[Interpreted, this concerns Deme]trius king of Greece who sought,
on the counsel of those who seek smooth things, to enter Jerusalem.
[But God did not permit the city to be delivered] into the hands of the
kings of Greece, from the time of Antiochus until the coming of the
rulers of the Kittim. But then she shall be trampled under their feet ...
The lion tears enough for its cubs and it chokes prey for its
lionesses (ii, 12a).
[Interpreted, this] concerns the furious young lion who strikes by
means of his great men, and by means of the men of his council.
[And chokes prey for its lionesses; and it fills] its caves [with prey]
and its dens with victims (ii, 12a—b).
Interpreted, this concerns the furious young lion [who executes
revenge] on those who seek smooth things and hangs men alive, ...
formerly in Israel. Because of a man hanged alive on [the] tree, He
proclaims, ‘Behold I am against [you, says the Lord of Hosts’].

Woe to the city of blood; it is full of lies and rapine (iii, Ia—b).
Interpreted, this is the city of Ephraim, those who seek smooth
things during the last days, who walk in lies and falsehood.
The prowler is not wanting, noise of whip and noise of rattling
wheel, prancing horse and jolting chariot, charging horsemen, flame
and glittering spear, a multitude of the slain and a heap of carcasses.
There is no end to the corpses; they stumble upon their corpses (iii,
Ic—3).
Interpreted, this concerns the dominion of those who seek smooth
things, from the midst of whose assembly the sword of the nations shall
never be wanting. Captivity, looting, and burning shall be among them,
and exile out of dread for the enemy. A multitude of guilty corpses shall
fall in their days; there shall be no end to the sum of their slain. They
shall also stumble upon their body of flesh because of their guilty
counsel.
Because of the many harlotries of the well-favoured harlot, the
mistress of seduction, she who sells nations through her harlotries
and families through her seductions (iii, 4).
Interpreted, this concerns those who lead Ephraim astray, who lead
many astray through their false teaching, their lying tongue, and
deceitful lips - kings, princes, priests, and people, together with the
stranger who joins them. Cities and families shall perish through their
counsel; honourable men and rulers shall fall through their tongue’s
[decision].

I will cast filth upon you and treat you with contempt and render you
despicable, so that all who look upon you shall flee from you (iii, 6—
7a).
Interpreted, this concerns those who seek smooth things, whose evil
deeds shall be uncovered to all Israel at the end of time. Many shall
understand their iniquity and treat them with contempt because of their
guilty presumption. When the glory of Judah shall arise, the simple of
Ephraim shall flee from their assembly; they shall abandon those who
lead them astray and shall join Israel.
They shall say, Nineveh is laid waste; who shall grieve over her?
Whence shall I seek comforters for you? (iii, 7b).
Interpreted, this concerns those who seek smooth things, whose

shall lead the assembly astray no more, and the simple shall support
their council no more.
Are you better than Amon which lay among the rivers? (iii, 8a).

his little ones shall go into captivity. His mighty men and honourable
men [shall perish] by the sword.

Commentary on Habakkuk (IQpHab)
This well-preserved and detailed exposition of the first two chapters of
the Book of Habakkuk comes from Cave I and was published in 1950
(M. Burrows, The Dead Sea Scrolls of St Mark’s Monastery, I, New
Haven, 1950, pls. LV—LXI).
The palaeographical dating of the manuscript (30—1 BCE) has
been confirmed by radiocarbon tests (120—5 BCE; cf. above, pp. 12
—13). The Habakkuk Commentary is one of the main sources for the
study of Qumran origins, as well as Essene Bible exegesis and the
sect’s theology regarding prophecy. The historical and doctrinal
aspects of the document are analysed in Chapters III and IV.

[There is quarrelling and contention] (i, 3b).
So the law is weak [and justice never goes forth] (i, 4a-b).
[Interpreted] this concerns those who have despised the Law of God
[For the wicked encompasses] the righteous (i, 4c).
[The wicked is the Wicked Priest, and the righteous] is the Teacher
of Righteousness...
[So] justice goes forth [perverted] (i, 4d). ...
[Behold the nations and see, marvel and be astonished; for I
accomplish a deed in your days, but you will not believe it when] II
told (i, 5).
[Interpreted, this concerns] those who were unfaithful together with
the Liar, in that they [did] not [listen to the word received by] the
Teacher of Righteousness from the mouth of God. And it concerns the
unfaithful of the New [Covenant] in that they have not believed in the
Covenant of God [and have profaned] His holy Name. And likewise,
this saying is to be interpreted [as concerning those who] will be
unfaithful at the end of days. They, the men of violence and the
breakers of the Covenant, will not believe when they hear all that [is to
happen to] the final generation from the Priest [in whose heart] God set
[understanding] that he might interpret all the words of His servants the
Prophets, through whom He foretold all that would happen to His
people and [His land].
For behold, I rouse the Chaldeans, that [bitter and hasty] nation (i,

6a).
Interpreted, this concerns the Kittim [who are] quick and valiant in
war, causing many to perish. [All the world shall fall] under the dominion
of the Kittim, and the [wicked ... ] they shall not believe in the laws of
[God ... ]
[Who march through the breadth of the earth to take possession of
dwellings which are not their own] (i, 6b).
... III they shall march across the plain, smiting and plundering the
cities of the earth. For it is as He said, To take possession of
dwellings which are not their own.
They are fearsome and terrible; their justice and grandeur proceed
from themselves (i, 7).
Interpreted, this concerns the Kittim who inspire all the nations with
fear [and dread]. All their evil plotting is done with intention and they
deal with all the nations in cunning and guile.
Their horses are smifter than leopards and fleeter than evening
wolves. Their horses step forward proudly and spread their wings;
they fly from afar like an eagle avid to devour. All of them come for
violence; the look on their faces is like the east wind (i, 8—9a).
[Interpreted, this] concerns the Kittim who trample the earth with their
horses and beasts. They come from afar, from the islands of the sea,
to devour all the peoples like an eagle which cannot be satisfied, and
they address [all the peoples] with anger and [wrath and fury] and
indignation. For it is as He said, The look on their faces is like the
east wind.
[They heap up] captives [like sand] (i, 9b).
IV They scoff [at kings], and princes are their laughing-stock (i, 10a).
Interpreted, this means that they mock the great and despise the
venerable; they ridicule kings and princes and scoff at the mighty host.


---

## Page 564

They laugh at every fortress; they pile up earth and take it (i, 10b).
Interpreted, this concerns the commanders of the Kittim who
despise the fortresses of the peoples and laugh at them in derision. To
capture them, they encircle them with a mighty host, and out of fear and
terror they deliver themselves into their hands. They destroy them
because of the sins of their inhabitants.
The wind then sweeps on and passes; and they make of their
strength their god (i, II).
Interpreted, [this concerns] the commanders of the Kittim who, on the
counsel of [the] House of Guilt, pass one in front of the other; one after
another [their] commanders come to lay waste the earth. [And they
make of their strength their god]: interpreted, this concerns [ ... all] the
peoples ...
[Art Thou not from everlasting, O Lord, my God, my Holy One? We
shall not die.] Thou hast ordained them, [O Lord], V for judgement;
Thou hast established them, 0 Rock, for chastisement. Their eyes
are too pure to behold evil; and Thou canst not look on distress (i, 12
—13a).
Interpreted, this saying means that God will not destroy His people
by the hand of the nations; God will execute the judgement of the
nations by the hand of His elect. And through their chastisement all the
wicked of His people shall expiate their guilt who keep His
commandments in their distress. For it is as he said, Too pure of eyes
to behold evil: interpreted, this means that they have not lusted after
their eyes during the age of wickedness.
O traitors, why do you stare and stay silent when the wicked
swallows up one more righteous than he? (i, 13b).
Interpreted, this concerns the House of Absalom and the members
of its council who were silent at the time of the chastisement of the
Teacher of Righteousness and gave him no help against the Liar who
flouted the Law in the midst of their whole [congregation].

Thou dealest with men like the fish of the sea, like creeping things,
to rule over them. They draw [them all up with a fish-hook], and drag
them out with their net, and gather them in [their seine. Therefore
they sacrifice] to their net. Therefore they rejoice [and exult and burn
incense to their seine; for by them] their portion is fat [and their
sustenance rich] (i, 14—16).
... VI the Kittim. And they shall gather in their riches, together with all
their booty, like the fish of the sea. And as for that which He said,
Therefore they sacrifice to their net and burn incense to their seine:
interpreted, this means that they sacrifice to their standards and
worship their weapons of war. For by them their portion is fat and their
sustenance rich: interpreted, this means that they divide their yoke
and their tribute ― their sustenance - over all the peoples year by
year, ravaging many lands.
Therefore their sword is ever drawn to massacre nations
mercilessly (i, 17).
Interpreted, this concerns the Kittim who cause many to perish by
the sword - youths, grown men, the aged, women and children - and
who even take no pity on the fruit of the womb.
I will take my stand to watch and will station myself upon my
fortress. I will watch to see what He will say to me and how [He will
answer] my complaint. And the Lord answered [and said to me, ‘Wtite
down the vision and make it plain] upon the tablets, that [he who
reads] may read it speedily (ii, 1—2).
... VII and God told Habakkuk to write down that which would happen
to the final generation, but He did not make known to him when time
would come to an end. And as for that which He said, That he who
reads may read it speedily: interpreted this concerns the Teacher of
Righteousness, to whom God made known all the mysteries of the
words of His servants the Prophets.
For there shall be yet another vision concerning the appointed


---

## Page 566

time. It shall tell of the end and shall not lie (ii, 3a).
Interpreted, this means that the final age shall be prolonged, and
shall exceed all that the Prophets have said; for the mysteries of God
are astounding.
If it tarries, wait for it, for it shall surely come and shall not be late
(ii, 3b). Interpreted, this concerns the men of truth who keep the Law,
whose hands shall not slacken in the service of truth when the final age
is prolonged. For all the ages of God reach their appointed end as he
determines for them in the mysteries of His wisdom.
Behold, [his soul] is puffed up and is not upright (ii, 4a).
Interpreted, this means that [the wicked] shall double their guilt upon
themselves [and it shall not be forgiven] when they are judged ...
[But the righteous shall live by his faith] (ii, 4b).
VIII Interpreted, this concerns all those who observe the Law in the
House of Judah, whom God will deliver from the House of Judgement
because of their suffering and because of their faith in the Teacher of
Righteousness.
Moreover, the arrogant man seizes wealth without halting. He
widens his gullet like Hell and like Death he has never enough. All
the nations are gathered to him and all the peoples are assembled
to him. Will they not all of them taunt him and jeer at him saying,
‘Woe to him who amasses that which is not his! How long will he load
himself up with pledges?’ (ii, 5—6).
Interpreted, this concerns the Wicked Priest who was called by the
name of truth when he first arose. But when he ruled over Israel his
heart became proud, and he forsook God and betrayed the precepts
for the sake of riches. He robbed and amassed the riches of the men
of violence who rebelled against God, and he took the wealth of the
peoples, heaping sinful iniquity upon himself. And he lived in the ways
of abominations amidst every unclean defilement.

Shall not your oppressors suddenly arise and your torturers
awaken; and shall you not become their prey? Because you have
plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall
plunder you (ii, 7—8a).
[Interpreted, this concerns] the Priest who rebelled [and violated] the
precepts [of God ... to command] IX his chastisement by means of the
judgements of wickedness. And they inflicted horrors of evil diseases
and took vengeance upon his body of flesh. And as for that which He
said, Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of
the peoples shall plunder you: interpreted this concerns the last
Priests of Jerusalem, who shall amass money and wealth by
plundering the peoples. But in the last days, their riches and booty shall
be delivered into the hands of the army of the Kittim, for it is they who
shall be the remnant of the peoples.
Because of the blood of men and the violence done to the land, to
the city, and to all its inhabitants (ii, 8b).
Interpreted, this concerns the Wicked Priest whom God delivered
into the hands of his enemies because of the iniquity committed
against the Teacher of Righteousness and the men of his Council, that
he might be humbled by means of a destroying scourge, in bitterness
of soul, because he had done wickedly to His elect.
Woe to him who gets evil profit for his house; who perches his nest
high to be safe from the hand of evil! You have devised shame to
your house: by cutting off many peoples you have forfeited your own
soul. For the [stone] cries out [from] the wall [and] the beam from the
woodwork replies (ii, 9—11).
[Interpreted, this] concerns the [Priest] who ... X that its stones might
be laid in oppression and the beam of its woodwork in robbery. And
as for that which He said, By cutting off many peoples you have
forfeited your own soul: interpreted this concerns the condemned
House whose judgement God will pronounce in the midst of many
peoples. He will bring him thence for judgement and will declare him

guilty in the midst of them, and will chastise him with fire of brimstone.
Woe to him who builds a city with blood and founds a town upon
falsehood! Behold, is it not from the Lord of Hosts that the peoples
shall labour for fire and the nations shall strive for naught? (ii, 12—
13).
Interpreted, this concerns the Spouter of Lies who led many astray
that he might build his city of vanity with blood and raise a
congregation on deceit, causing many thereby to perform a service of
vanity for the sake of its glory, and to be pregnant with [works] of
deceit, that their labour might be for nothing and that they might be
punished with fire who vilified and outraged the elect of God.
For as the waters cover the sea, so shall the earth be filled with the
knowledge of the glory of the Lord (ii, 14).
Interpreted, [this means that] when they return ... XI the lies. And
afterwards, knowledge shall be revealed to them abundantly, like the
waters of the sea.
Woe to him who causes his neighbours to drink; who pours out his
venom to make them drunk that he may gaze on their feasts (ii, 15)
Interpreted, this concerns the Wicked Priest who pursued the
Teacher of Righteousness to the house of his exile that he might
confuse him with his venomous fury. And at the time appointed for rest,
for the Day of Atonement, he appeared before them to confuse them,
and to cause them to stumble on the Day of Fasting, their Sabbath of
repose.
You have filled yourself with ignominy more than with glory. Drink
also, and stagger! The cup of the Lord’s right hand shall come round
to you and shame shall come on your glory (ii, 16).
Interpreted, this concerns the Priest whose ignominy was greater
than his glory. For he did not circumcise the foreskin of his heart, and
he walked in the ways of drunkenness that he might quench his thirst.
But the cup of the wrath of God shall confuse him, multiplying his ... and
the pain of ...

[For the violence done to Lebanon shall overwhelm you, and the
destruction of the beasts] XII shall terrify you, because of the blood of
men and the violence done to the land, the city, and all its
inhabitants (ii, 17).
Interpreted, this saying concerns the Wicked Priest, inasmuch as he
shall be paid the reward which he himself tendered to the Poor. For
Lebanon is the Council of the Community; and the beasts are the
simple of Judah who keep the Law. As he himself plotted the
destruction of the Poor, so will God condemn him to destruction. And
as for that which He said, Because of the blood of the city and the
violence done to the land: interpreted, the city is Jerusalem where the
Wicked Priest committed abominable deeds and defiled the Temple
of God. The violence done to the land: these are the cities of Judah
where he robbed the Poor of their possessions.
Of what use is an idol that its maker should shape it, a molten
image, a fatling of lies? For the craftsman puts his trust in his own
creation when he makes dumb idols (ii, 18).
Interpreted, this saying concerns all the idols of the nations which
they make so that they may serve and worship them. But they shall not
deliver them on the Day of Judgement.
Woe [to him who says] to wood, ‘Awake’, and to dumb [stone,
‘Arise’! Can such a thing give guidance? Behold, it is covered with
gold and silver but there is no spirit within it. But the Lord is in His
holy Temple]: XIII let all the earth be silent before Him! (lii, 19—20).
Interpreted, this concerns all the nations which serve stone and
wood. But on the Day of Judgement, God will destroy from the earth all
idolatrous and wicked men.
Commentary on Zephaniah (1Q15, 4Q170)

## Page 570

The relics of a Zephaniah Commentary from Cave 1, covering Zeph.
i, 18-ii, 2 and using palaeo-Hebrew letters for the divine name, are
badly mutilated. A lengthy quotation is followed by the word pesher
(interpretation), and the expression ‘land of Judah’ implies that the
divine anger spoken of by the prophet was understood to be directed
against the Judaeans. Two small fragments from Cave 4 represent two
broken lines of Zephaniah i, 12—13; a couple of words which are not
biblical precede the introductory formula, pishro (its interpretation), but
the actual commentary is lost. The two excerpts are presented in the
order of the biblical text.

Commentary on Psalms (1Q16, 4Q171, 4Q173)
Cave I has preserved a few scraps of a commentary on Psalms Ivii
and Ixviii. Most of them are too small for a coherent translation, but frs.

importantly, two manuscripts with Herodian script from Cave 4

interpreter of knowledge in order to ... II they shall perish by the sword
and famine and plague.
Relent from anger and abandon wrath. Do not be angry; it tends
only to evil, for the wicked shall be cut off (8-9a).
Interpreted, this concerns all those who return to the Law, to those
who do not refuse to turn away from their evil. For all those who are
stubborn in turning away from their iniquity shall be cut off.
But those who wait for the Lord shall possess the land (9b).
Interpreted, this is the congregation of His elect who do His will.
A little while and the wicked shall be no more; I will look towards his

But the humble shall possess the land and delight in abundant

The wicked plots against the righteous and gnashes [his teeth a]t

House of Judah, who have plotted to destroy those who practise the
law, who are in the Council of the Community. And God will not forsake
them to their hands.
The wicked draw the sword and bend their bow to bring down the

Commentary on an Unidentifiable Text
(4Q183)
Three fragments of a biblical commentary, indicated by the
introductory formula, ‘And that which he said’, which is common in
pesher literature, have been published by J. M. Allegro. None of the
quotations has been preserved, but the phraseology and the historical
allusions recall the Habakkuk Commentary and other pesharim. The
divine names ‘God’ (el) and ‘the Lord’ (Yhwh) are written in palaeo-
Hebrew script. Only fr. 2 is suitable for translation. 4Q172 (DJD, V, 50-
1) is also an amalgam of commentaries on unidentified texts, but the
fragments are so small as to preclude altogether any translation.

Florilegium or Midrash on the Last Days
(4Q174)
This collection of texts assembled from 2 Samuel and the Psalter, and


---

## Page 578

combined with other scriptural passages, serves to present the
sectarian doctrine identifying the Community with the Temple, and to
announce the coming of the two Messiahs, the ‘Branch of David’ and
the ‘Interpreter of the Law’. Originating from Cave 4 (4Q174) and
known also as ‘Florilegium’, it probably belongs to the late first century
BCE.
For the editio princeps, see J. M. Allegro and A. A. Anderson, DJD,
V, 53-7.
I ... [I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them that
they may dwell there and be troubled no more by their] enemies. No
son of iniquity [shall afflict them again] as formerly, from the day that
[I set judges] over my people Israel (2 Sam. vii, 10).
This is the House which [He will build for them in the] last days, as it
is written in the book of Moses, In the sanctuary which Thy hands
have established, O Lord, the Lord shall reign for ever and ever
(Exod. xv, 17-18). This is the House into which [the unclean shall] never
[enter, nor the uncircumcised,] nor the Ammonite, nor the Moabite, nor
the half-breed, nor the foreigner, nor the stranger, ever; for there shall
My Holy Ones be. [Its glory shall endure] for ever; it shall appear above
it perpetually And strangers shall lay it waste no more, as they formerly
laid waste the Sanctuary of Israel because of its sin. He has
commanded that a Sanctuary of men be built for Himself, that there
they may send up, like the smoke of incense, the works of the Law.
And concerning His words to David, And I [willgive] you [rest] from all
your enemies (2 Sam. vii, 11), this means that He will give them rest
from all the children of Belial who cause them to stumble so that they
may be destroyed [by their errors,] just as they came with a [devilish]
plan to cause the [sons] of light to stumble and to devise against them
a wicked plot, that [they might become subject] to Belial in their
[wicked] straying.
The Lord declares to you that He will build you a House (2 Sam.
vii, 11c).1 I will raise up your seed after you (2 Sam. vii, 12). I will

## Page 579

establish the throne of his kingdom [for ever] (2 Sam. vii, 13). [I willbe]
his father and he shall be my son (2 Sam. vii, 14). He is the Branch of
David who shall arise with the Interpreter of the Law [to rule] in Zion [at
the end] of time. As it is written, I will raise up the tent of David that is
fallen (Amos ix, 11). That is to say, the fallen tent of David is he who
shall arise to save Israel.
Explanation of How blessed is the man who does not walk in the
counsel of the wicked (Ps. i, 1). Interpreted, this saying [concerns]
those who turn aside from the way [of the people] as it is written in the
book of Isaiah the Prophet concerning the last days, It came to pass
that [the Lord turned me aside, as with a mighty hand, from walking in
the way of ] this people (Isa. viii, 11). They are those of whom it is
written in the book of Ezekiel the Prophet, The Levites [strayed far
from me, following] their idols (Ezek. xliv, Prophet, are the sons of
Zadok who [seek their own] counsel and follow 10). They are the sons
of Zadok who [seek their own] counsel and follow [their own inclination]
apart from the Council of the Community.
[Why] do the nations [rage] and the peoples meditate [vanity? Why
do the kings of the earth] rise up, [and the] princes take counsel
together against the Lord and against [His Messiah]? (Ps. ii, 1).
Interpreted, this saying concerns [the kings of the nations] who shall
[rage against] the elect of Israel in the last days. 11 This shall be the
time of the trial to co[me concerning the house of J]udah so as to
perfect ... Belial, and a remnant of the people shall be left according to
the lot (assigned to them), and they shall practise the whole Law...
Moses. This is the time of which it is written in the book of Daniel the
Prophet: But the wicked shall do wickedly and shall not understand,
but the righteous shall purify themselves and make themselves white
(Dan. xii, 10). The people who know God shall be strong. They are the
masters who understand...
Testimonia or Messianic Anthology

## Page 580

(4Q175)
This short document from Cave 4 (4Q175), dating to the early first
century BCE and similar in literary style to the Christian Testimonia or
collections of messianic proof-texts, includes five quotations arranged
in four groups. Only the last of them is followed by an interpretation.
The first group consists of two texts from Deuteronomy referring to
the prophet similar to Moses; the second is an extract from a prophecy
of Balaam about the Royal Messiah; the third is a blessing of the
Levites and, implicitly, of the Priest-Messiah.
The last group opens with a verse from Joshua, which is then
expounded by means of a quotation from the sectarian Psalms of
Joshua (cf. 4Q379 below, p. 547). Most experts hold that the
commentator, bearing in mind the biblical passage, is alluding to three
characters: a father (‘an accursed man’) and his two sons. However,
the verb ‘arose’ in the second sentence is in the singular, and it would
seem correct to interpret this text as referring to the two brothers only.
For the editio princeps, see J. M. Allegro and A. A. Anderson, DJD,
V, 57-60.
The Lord spoke to Moses saying:
You have heard the words which this people have spoken to you;
all they have said is right. Othat their heart were always like this, to
fear me and to keep my commandments always, that it might be well
with them and their children for ever! (Deut. v, 28-9). I will raise up for
them a Prophet like you from among their brethren. I will put my
words into his mouth and he shall tell them all that I command him.
And I will require a reckoning of whoever will not listen to the words
which the Prophet shall speak in my Name (Deut. xviii, 18-19).
He took up his discourse and said:
Oracle of Balaam son of Beor. Oracle of the man whose eye is

penetrating. Oracle of him who has heard the words of God, who
knows the wisdom of the Most High and sees the vision of the
Almighty, who falls and his eyes are opened. I see him but not now. I
behold him but not near. A star shall come out of Jacob and a
sceptre shall rise out of Israel; he shall crush the temples of Moab
and destroy all the children of Sheth (Num. xxiv, 15-17).
And of Levi he said:
Give Thy Tummim to Levi, and Thy Urimto Thy pious one whom
Thou didst test at Massah, and with whom Thou didst quarrel at the
waters of Meribah; who said to his father and mother, ‘I know you not’,
and who did not acknowledge his brother, or know his sons. For they
observed Thy word and kept Thy Covenant. They shall cause Thy
precepts to shine before Jacoband Thy Law before Israel. They shall
send up incense towards Thy nostrils and place a burnt-offering upon
Thine altar. Bless his power, O Lord, and delight in the work of his
hands. Smite the loins of his adversaries and let his enemies rise no
more (Deut. xxxiii, 8-11).
When Joshua had finished offering praise and thanksgiving, he said:
Cursed be the man who rebuilds this city! May he lay its
foundation on his first-born, and set its gate upon his youngest son
(Josh. vi, 26). Behold, an accursed man, a man of Belial, has risen to
become a fowler’s net to his people, and a cause of destruction to all
his neighbours. And [his brother] arose [and ruled in li]es, both being
instruments of violence. They have rebuilt [this city and have set up for
it] a wall and towers to make of it a stronghold of ungodliness in Israel,
and a horror in Ephraim and in Judah ... They have committed an
abomination in the land, and a great blasphemy among the children [of
Jacob. They have shed blood] like water upon the ramparts of the
daughter of Zion and within the precincts of Jerusalem.
Ordinances or Commentaries on Biblical Law


---

## Page 582

(4Q159, 4Q513-14)
Three manuscripts from Cave 4 (4Q159, 4Q513-14), and probably
belonging to the turn of the era, include reinterpretations of various
biblical laws.
In the first statute, the interpreter deduces from Deut. xxiii, 25—6 that
a poor man may eat ears of corn in the field of another person, but is
not allowed to take any home. On a threshing-floor, however, he may
both eat and gather provisions for his family.
Next follows a statute referring to the half-shekel tax contributed by
every Israelite aged twenty to the upkeep of the place of worship. Later
Jewish tradition interpreted this passage as instituting a yearly tax to
be paid by every male Israelite (cf. Neh. x, 32; Matth. xvii, 24-7; see
also the treatise Shekalim or Shekel Dues in the Mishnah). The
Qumran ordinance, however, insists on one single payment, thereby
complying with the scriptural rule and at the same time withholding
regular support from the Temple in Jerusalem. Here 4Q159 and
4Q513, frs. 1—2, partly overlap.
The third statute (4Q159, frs. 2-4) deals with the prohibition against
selling an Israelite as a slave (cf. Lev. xxv, 39-46); with cases to be
judged by a court of twelve magistrates; with the forbidden interchange
of garments between men and women (cf. Deut. xxii, 5); and with the
charge laid by a husband against his wife that she was not a virgin
when he married her (Deut. xxii, 13-21).
Finally, 4Q513, frs. 2-4, and 4Q514 legislate on purity rules.
For the editio princeps, see J. M. Allegro and A. A. Anderson, DJD,
V, 6-9; M. Baillet, DJD, VII, 287-98.

[concerning her] trustworthiness. If he has not lied concerning her, she

The Heavenly Prince Melchizedek
(11Q13)
A striking mid-first-century BCE document, composed of eleven
fragments from Cave 11 and centred on the mysterious figure of
Melchizedek, was first published by A. S. van der Woude in 1965. It
takes the form of an eschatological midrash in which the proclamation
of liberty to the captives at the end of days (Isa. lxi, 1) is understood as
being part of the general restoration of property during the year of


---

## Page 585

Jubilee (Lev. xxv, 13), seen in the Bible (Deut. xv, 2) as a remission of
debts.
The heavenly deliverer is Melchizedek. Identical with the archangel
Michael, he is the head of the ‘sons of Heaven’ or ‘gods of Justice’ and
is referred to as elohim and el. The same terminology occurs in the
Songs for the Holocaust of the Sabbath. These Hebrew words
normally mean ‘God’, but in certain specific contexts Jewish tradition
also explains elohim as primarily designating a ‘judge’. Here
Melchizedek is portrayed as presiding over the final Judgement and
condemnation of his demonic counterpart, Belial/Satan, the Prince of
Darkness, elsewhere also called Melkiresha’ (cf. pp. 391, 570). The
great act of deliverance is expected to occur on the Day of Atonement
at the end of the tenth Jubilee cycle.
This manuscript sheds valuable light not only on the Melchizedek
figure in the Epistle to the Hebrews vii, but also on the development of
the messianic concept in the New Testament and early Christianity.
For the editio princeps, see F. García Martinez, E. J. C. Tigchelaar
and A. S. van der Woude, DJD, XXIII, 221-41.
Frs. 1-4
II... And concerning that which He said, In [this] year ofJubilee [each of
you shall return to his property (Lev. xxv, 13); and likewise, And this is
the manner of release:] every creditor shall release that which he has
lent [to his neighbour. He shall not exact it of his neighbour and his
brother], for God’s release [has been proclaimed] (Deut. xv, 2). [And it
will be proclaimed at] the end of days concerning the captives as [He
said, To proclaim liberty to the captives (Isa. lxi, 1). Its interpretation is
that He] will assign them to the Sons of Heaven and to the inheritance
of Melchizedek; f[or He will cast] their [lot] amid the po[rtions of
Melchize]dek, who will return them there and will proclaim to them
liberty, forgiving them [the wrong-doings] of all their iniquities.

[Ju]bilee, when all the Sons of [Light] and the men of the lot of
Mel[chi]zedek will be atoned for. [And] a statute concerns them [to
prov]ide them with their rewards. For this is the moment of the Year of
Grace for Melchizedek. [And h]e will, by his strength, judge the holy
ones of God, executing judgement as it is written concerning him in the
Songs of David, who said, ELOHIM has taken his place in the divine
council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgement (Psalms lxxxii,
1). And it was concerning him that he said, (Let the assembly of the
peoples) return to the height above them; EL (god) will judge the
peoples (Psalms vii, 7-8). As for that which he s[aid, How long will you]
judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah (Psalms lxxxii,
2), its interpretation concerns Belial and the spirits of his lot [who]
rebelled by turning away from the precepts of God to ... And
Melchizedek will avenge the vengeance of the judgements of God...
and he will drag [them from the hand of] Belial and from the hand of all
the sp[irits of] his [lot]. And all the ‘gods [of Justice’] will come to his aid
[to] attend to the de[struction] of Belial. And the height is ... all the sons
of God... this ... This is the day of [Peace/Salvation] concerning which
[God] spoke [through Isa]iah the prophet, who said, [How] beautiful
upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who proclaims
peace, who brings good news, who proclaims salvation, who says to
Zion: Your ELOHIM [reigns] (Isa. lii, 7). Its interpretation; the
mountains are the prophets... and the messenger is the Anointed one
of the spirit, concerning whom Dan[iel] said, [Until an anointed one, a
prince (Dan. ix, 25)] ... [And he who brings] good [news] , who
proclaims [salvation]: it is concerning him that it is written... [To
comfort all who mourn, to grant to those who mourn in Zion] (Isa. lxi,
2-3). To comfort [those who mourn: its interpretation], to make them
understand all the ages of t[ime] ... In truth ... will turn away from Belial...
by the judgement[s] of God, as it is written concerning him, [who says
toZion]; your ELOHIM reigns. Zion is ..., those who uphold the
Covenant, who turn from walking [in] the way of the people. And your
ELOHIM is [Melchizedek, who will save them from] the hand of Belial.
As for that which He said, Then you shall send abroad the trump[et
in] all the land (Lev. xxv, 9) ...

Consolations or Tanhumim
(4Q176)
A large number of small fragments from a Cave 4 manuscript (4Q176),
edited by J. M. Allegro in 1968, represent a scriptural anthology
centred on the theme of divine consolation. Originally, each citation
was accompanied by a sectarian exegesis, but only a few examples of
the latter survive. The majority of the extant remains belong to Isaiah xl-
lv (Ps. lxxix, 2-3; Isa. xl, 1-5; xli, 8-9; xlix, 13-17; xliii, 1-2, 4-6; li, 22-3; lii,
1-3; liv, 4-10; lii, 1-2; Zech. xiii, 9). The translated passage is based on
Psalm lxxix, 2-3, and is followed by a new title—From the Book of
Isaiah: Consolations—and the quotation of the opening verses of Isa.
xl. The four asterisks symbolize the Tetragram indicated in the
manuscript simply by dots.
For the editio princeps, see J. M. Allegro and A. A. Anderson, DJD,
V, 60-67.
I And he shall accomplish Thy miracles and Thy righteousness among
Thy people. And they shall... Thy sanctuary, and shall dispute with the
kingdoms over the blood of ... Jerusalem and shall see the bodies of
Thy priests... and none to bury them (Ps. lxxix, 3). From the Book of
Isaiah: Consolations [Comfort, comfort, my people] —says your God -
speak to the heart of Jerusalem and c[ry to her that] her [bondage is
completed], that her punishment is accepted, that she has received
from the hand of **** double for allhersins... (Isa. xl, 1-3).
Catenae or Interpretation of Biblical Texts on
the Last Days


---

## Page 588

(4Q177, 4Q182)
These two documents consist of over thirty fragments, none of which
amounts to units of coherent text. The connecting theme is
eschatology, with the phrase ‘at the end of days’ appearing half a
dozen times. The majority of the biblical quotations are from the
Psalms (Ps. vi, xi, xii, xiii, xvi), but explicit mentions are also made of
‘the Book of the Law’ (or possibly ‘the Second Law’) (4Q177, frs. 1-4,
1. 14), ‘the Book of Ezekiel, the prophet’ (4Q177, fr. 7, 1.3), and ‘the
Book of Jerem[iah the prophet?]’ (4Q182, fr. 1, 1. 4). The citations are
introduced by ‘as it is written‘, and the expository sections start with
pesher. The following typically sectarian expressions are attested:
‘party of light’ (fr. 1-4, 1. 8), ‘men of his council’ (ibid., 1. 16),
‘congregation of seekers of smooth things’ (fr. 9, 1. 4), ‘men of Belial’
(fr. 10-11, 1. 4), ‘Interpreter of the Law’ (ibid., 1. 5), ‘sons of light’ (fr.
12-13 i, 11.7, 11), ‘council of the Community’ (fr. 14,1. 5).
For the editio princeps, see J. M. Allegro and A. A. Anderson, DJD,
V, 64-74, 80-81; cf. J. Strugnell, RQ 7(1970), 236-46, 256.
4Q177 frs. 10-11, 7, 9, 20, 26 (as reconstructed
by Strugnell)

Jubilees
(4Q216-28, 1Q17-18, 2Q19-20, 3Q5, 4Q482(?),
11Q12)
The pseudepigraphon, known prior to Qumran from a complete
Ethiopic and partial Greek, Latin and Syriac translations, has for the
first time surfaced in a large number of mostly small fragments in its
Hebrew original in five Qumran caves. The work itself is a midrashic
retelling of the story of Genesis (and the beginning of Exodus) in the
form of a revelation conveyed by angels to Moses. Apart from some
4Q relics, the texts from 1-3Q and 11Q are too mutilated to provide the
basis for an English translation and their chief significance lies in their
attestation of a Hebrew original generally close to the account
preserved in the ancient versions.
The 4Q material includes some larger fragments suitable for
rendering into English, and 4Q225, surnamed pseudo-Jubilees by the
editors, but which could just as well be accepted simply as an
alternative account, reveals supplementary material of some
importance not only for Jubilees in general, but also for the study of the
Akedah or story of the sacrifice of Isaac, certain features of which
receive here their first pre-Christian attestation.
4Q216, which in part may be the earliest Jubilees manuscript and
should be dated palaeographically to the last quarter of the second
century BCE, testifies in the form of small fragments to the beginning
of the book (between 1, 1 and 11, 24 of the Ethiopic version). It
contains the Hebrew title of the work, Book of the Divisions of the
Times, repeated also in other 4Q fragments, a title already known from
the Damascus Document (XVI, 3). 4Q217 and 218, the first consisting
of eleven tiny papyrus fragments and the second of a single small
leather fragment, both probably derive from the opening chapters of
Jubilees. 4Q219, also poorly preserved, has preserved tit-bits from


---

## Page 591

chapters xxi, 1 to XXII, 1. Its only noteworthy contribution is that in col.
11, lines 35-6, it dates the death of Abraham correctly to the forty-third
jubilee counted from the creation, and not to the forty-fourth, as the
Ethiopic version does. 4QJube 4Q220 supplies a single largish, hence
translatable, fragment of Jub. xxi, 5-10 written in an early Herodian
script (last three decades of the first century BCE). It occasionally
overlaps with 4Q219, thus permitting the filling in of two gaps. The
remaining four 4QJub manuscripts are once again so fragmentary that
no translation is possible. 4Q221 consists of thirty-seven tiny
fragments, covering small identified portions of Jub. xxi, 22 to xxxix, 9.
The six fragments of 4Q222 echo Jub. xxv, 9-12; XXVII, 6-7 and XLIX,
5(?) and the badly worn papyrus manuscripts of 4Q223-4, where
identifiable, reflect Jub. XXXII, 18 to XLI, 10.
Remains of three Hebrew manuscripts (4Q225-7) have preserved a
writing akin to Jubilees or representing a discrepant version of it. In
either case, ‘Pseudo-Jubilees’, the title chosen by the editors, is no
doubt a misnomer. Palaeographically, 4Q225 is dated to the turn of
the era; 4Q226 to the second half, and 4Q227 to the final decades, of
the first century BCE. Of the three fragments, the first and the third are
very damaged, but substantial parts of fragment 2 are extant. The
author recounts the sacrifice of Isaac with details which differ from the
Genesis story and display close parallels to the post-biblical
representation of the Akedah or Binding of Isaac, anticipating features
known from the Palestinian Targums (Ps. Jonathan and Neofiti on
Gen. xxii, 10 in col. 11.4; Ps. Jon. on Gen. xxii, 11, and Pirqe de-Rabbi
Eliezer 105c on the same passage in col. 11.1). The presence of
angels at the sacrifice is repeatedly attested in the Targums. 4Q225
provides the earliest (pre-Christian) evidence for the rabbinic story of
Isaac’s voluntary self-sacrifice which is thought to have supplied a
model for the formulation by New Testament writers of the teaching on
the sacrificial death of Jesus. Cf. G. Vermes, Scripture and Tradition
in Judaism (Brill, 1961), 193-227. Cf. also G. Vermes, ‘New Light on
the Akedah from 4Q225’, JJS 47 (1996), 140-46.
4Q226 or psJubb is made up of fourteen fragments, half of them
unidentifiable. The first six mention Egypt, the wilderness, Joshua’s
crossing (of the Jordan) and the land of Canaan. Fr. 7, the largest,


---

## Page 592

returns to the aftermath of the sacrifice of Isaac and furnishes a text
closely resembling 4Q225 2, ii. The badly damaged fr. 2 of 4Q227 is
centred on the figure of Enoch, instructed by angels, testifying against
his contemporaries and the angels called Watchers. Allusion is made
to his writing activity, including astronomical knowledge which was to
stop the righteous from going astray. The two small fragments of
4Q227 contain references to Moses and to Enoch (cf. Jub. IV, 17-24)
and 4Q228 consists of one large and eight tiny fragments, one of
which (fr. 1, 1. 9) displays the phrase, ‘For thus is written in the
Divisions [of times]’. Hence it is identified as an unknown work quoting
the Book of Jubilees.

The Prayer of Enosh and Enoch
(4Q369)
Ten fragments, including three large ones, have survived of a
manuscript written with Herodian characters, apparently recording
prayers. There is no direct reference to the persons in whose mouths
the words are placed, but the context seems to indicate that the first
fragment is associated with Enosh, who according to Gen. iv, 26, was
the first human to call on the name of the Lord. Since line 10 in fr. 1,
col. 1 mentions Enoch, the editors have made a reasonable inference
in attributing to him the prayer in fr. 1, col. 11. Fr. 2 alludes to a war
against the lands without any context and frs. 3-9 contain nothing
intelligible.

The Book of Enoch
(4Q201-2, 204-12)
Various Qumran caves have yielded for the first time the original
Aramaic text of one of the major Pseudepigrapha, the Book of Enoch,
which was previously known from a complete Ethiopic translation and
from a Greek rendering of chapters I-XXXII and XCVII-CI, CVI-CVII, as
well as from a number of Greek quotations from chapters VI to xv
transmitted by the Byzantine writer George Syncellus. Qumran Cave 4
has yielded seven copies of the writing attested by, but not strictly
identical to, the Ethiopic, and four further copies of the related Book of
Giants, dependent on chapter VI of Enoch, fragments of which have
been discovered also in 1Q and 6Q. Palaeographically, all of them are
dated to between 200 BCE and the end of the pre-Christian era. The
differences they display concern partly the structure of the work, e.g.
the astronomical section is more developed in parts than the text from
which the Ethiopic Enoch LXXII-LXXXII was made, while the Book of
Parables (chaps. XXXVII-LXXI) with its Son of Man speculation is
completely lacking at Qumran. There are also noticeable stylistic
divergences which may be attributable more to the absence of a
unified text of Enoch than to the work of the Ethiopic translator.
The bulk of the fragments is too small for translation. It would be
wholly meaningless to render into English the retranslation into
Aramaic of the Ethiopic and/or Greek text supplied by their editor, J. T.
Milik, who has conjecturally filled the many gaps in the Qumran
manuscripts. The passages included in this volume are those which
make sense in themselves. The first excerpt (4Q201) supplies the
Aramaic names of the twenty chiefs of the fallen angels. The second
(4Q204) relates the miraculous birth of Noah, which should be
compared to the parallel accounts in the Genesis Apocryphon col. 11
and in the fragments of the Book of Noah (1Q19, 4Q534). The third

## Page 598

and fourth extracts (4Q206) testify to a recension noticeably different
from the corresponding Ethiopic version. The fifth (4Q209), the
Astronomical Book, is - as has been noted - considerably longer than
the Ethiopic. As for the Book of Giants, it is missing from the Ethiopic,
though it circulated in Manichaean, Talmudic and medieval Jewish
literature.

The Book of Giants
(1Q23-4, 2Q26, 4Q203, 530-33, 6Q8)
The Book of Giants is missing from the Ethiopic version of Enoch, but
it circulated among the Manichaeans (W. B. Henning, ‘The Book of
Giants’, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 11,
1943-46, 52-74) as well as in Talmudic and medieval Jewish literature
(bNid. 61a and Midrash Shemhazai and Azael), as has been
convincingly shown by J. T. Milik in his learned book, The Books of
Enoch: Aramaic Fragments of Qumran Cave 4(Oxford, 1976, 298-
339). Some of the features resemble the Book of Daniel.

their eyes fled from them... and they ro[se and op]ened their eyes and
they went to [Shemihaza, their father. Then] he told a story in the
congregation of [their co]lleagues, the Nephilin: ... I saw [a wonder] in

in [that] garden... Many [roo]ts grew out of their stock. [And out of one

Here is the end of the dream... [And] the giants were unable to explain
[the] dre[am]. [And he said...] You will give this [dr]eam [to Eno]ch, the

Ohiyah, his brother, answered and said before the giants, I, too, saw a
wonder in my dream this night. Behold the Ruler of heaven descended
to earth and thrones were set and the great Holy One sat. [Hundreds

An Admonition Associated with the Flood
(4Q370, 4Q185)
4Q370 is a rewritten account of the Noah story based on Genesis vi-ix;
two fragmentary columns have survived, only the first of which is
suitable for translation. Palaeographically, it is said to be late
Hasmonaean, i.e. from the first half of the first century BCE, but the
composition itself is pre-Qumran. Both the Tetragram and the divine
name ‘el are used. The badly damaged column 11 switches from
narrative to ethics and exhortation. Part of it can be reconstructed with
the help of 4Q185.
For the editio princeps of 4Q370, see Carol A. Newsom, DJD, XIX,
85-97.
4Q370 (4Q185)
I [And] He crowned the mountains with pro[duce] and poured food on

eyes,’ said the Lord. They rebelled (?) against God through their
ac[tio]ns, and the Lord judged them according to all their ways, and
according to the thoughts of the inclination of their [evil] hearts. And He
thundered at them in [His] power, and all the foundations of the earth

The Ages of the Creation
(4Q180)
A badly worn manuscript from Cave 4(4Q180) has been published
under this title by J. M. Allegro. Its decipherment and interpretation
have been further improved by J. Strugnell and J. T. Milik. The only
section yielding coherent sense deals with the myth of the fallen angels
and the daughters of men, which is based on Genesis vi, 1-4, and fully
developed in 1 Enoch. If Milik’s reconstruction is correct, the work
presents human history as divided into seventy weeks of years (70 x 7
years), the first ten of which cover the period from Noah to Abraham.
The manuscript is claimed by Strugnell to belong to the first century
CE.
For the editio princeps, see J. M. Allegro and A. A. Anderson, DJD,
V, 77-9; cf. J. Strugnell, RQ 7 (1970,) 252-4;J. T. Milik, JJS 23 (1972),
110-24.
Interpretation concerning the ages made by God, all the ages for the
accomplishment [of all the events, past] and future. Before ever He
created them, He determined the works of ... age by age. And it was
engraved on [heavenly] tablets... the ages of their domination. This is
the order of the cre[ation of man from Noah to Abraham, un]til he begot
Isaac; ten [weeks (of years)].
And the interpretation concerns Azazel and the angels who [came to
the daughters of men; and] they bore to them giants. And concerning
Azazel ... and iniquity, and to cause them all to inherit wickedness...

The Book of Noah
(1Q19, 1Q19 bis, 4Q534-6, 6Q8,19)
Several groups of small fragments from Qumran Caves 1, 4 and 6
appear to be the relics of a Book of Noah mentioned in Jubilees x, 13
and xxi, 10 and reproduced in an abbreviated form in Aramaic in the
Genesis Apocryphon 11ff. and in Enoch CVI (cf. J. T. Milik, DJD, I, 84-
6; 152; DJD, III, 116-19, 136). 1Q19 and 19bis are remains of a
Hebrew version; 6Q8 and 19 belong to an Aramaic Noah narrative.
1Q19, 6Q8 and 1QapGen deal with the miraculous birth of Noah, as
does also 4Q534, which was originally understood by scholars as
describing the birth of the Royal Messiah (cf. p. 370 above). In 1Q19 fr.
1 the subject is the miserable state of mankind before the Flood; frs. 3
and 13-14 (as well as 6Q8) allude to the birth of Noah, accompanied
by miraculous signs.

70.

Words of the Archangel Michael
(4Q529, 6Q23)
In this poorly preserved Aramaic fragment the speaker, Michael,
addresses the angels in general and the archangel Gabriel in line 4
about a vision. The subject is unclear, but since he refers to the sons of
Noah, Shem and Ham, and to the construction of a city filled with
wickedness, it is possible that the author alludes to the building of the
tower of Babel. If there are two mountains in each direction (east, west,
north, south), the ninth indicated in the text must be special: Zion or
Sinai?
For the editio princeps, see E. Puech, DJD, XXXI, 1-8.

The Testament of Levi (i)
(4Q213-114, 1Q21)
Among the numerous small fragments representing the Aramaic
Testament of Levi from Cave 4, all dating to the mid-first century BCE,
a damaged portion of two columns of 4Q213a contains parts of a
prayer of Levi. As the best part of the same text survives also in Greek
in a manuscript from Mt Athos (Monastery of Koutloumous, Codex 39,
dating to the eleventh century), it is possible to complete most of the
missing sections of this prayer. Other small Aramaic fragments of the
Testament of Levi, mentioning among other matters the ‘kingdom of
the high priesthood’, are listed under 1Q21 (cf. J. T. Milik, DJD, I, 87-
91).

Testaments of the Patriarchs: the Testament of
Levi or Testament of Jacob
(4Q537 and 540-41)
An Aramaic work of which numerous fragments are extant in Cave 4
resembles the Testament of Levi from among the Testaments of the
Twelve Patriarchs. The central figure is Levi, but the testament is
probably that of his father, Jacob. Hence 4Q537 is referred to also as
the Jacob Apocryphon. Palaeographically its proposed date is the end
of the second century BCE. Both 4Q537 and 541 allude to an
eschatological priestly figure (recalling the pseudepigraphic
Testament of Levi XVII-XVIII) whose mission encounters opposition
due to the wickedness of the men of his generation. 4Q537 probably
represents Jacob’s dream at Bethel. The three fragments of 4Q540
are very truncated and provide no basis for meaningful translation.
For the editio princeps, see E. Puech, DJD, XXXI, 171-90 and 225-

The Testament of Judah and Joseph
(4Q538-9)
Four small fragments of an Aramaic work (4Q538) were first
recognized as belonging to the Testament of Judah by J. T. Milik
(‘Ecrits préesséniens de Qumrân: d’Hénoch à Amram’, in Qumrân. Sa
piété, sa théologie et son milieu, ed. M. Delcor (1976), 91-106). The
script belongs to mid-first century BCE. The five fragments of the
Testament of Joseph (4Q539) are too small for translation. However,
the allusion to ‘my uncle Ishmael’ (fr. 3) whose children acquired
Joseph as a slave, and to the minister of Pharaoh, Pentephres, the
Greek form of Potiphar (fr. 4), who bought Joseph from the
Ishmaelites, seem to confirm Milik’s identification of the document.

The Testament of Naphtali
(4Q215)
Two reasonably intact fragments, dating to the turn of the era,
represent the Hebrew text of the Testament of Naphtali, with
occasional similarities to the version which survives in Greek. Fr. 1
partly overlaps with TNaphtali 1, 9, 11-12, without being identical with
it. Fr. 2 depicts the blessedness of the end of time and may belong to
a separate sectarian document.

Narrative and Poetic Composition (formerly
‘A Joseph Apocryphon’)
(4Q371-3)
4Q371-3 form a very fragmentary Hebrew narrative relating to the
period of the Patriarchs and Moses. Palaeographically they are dated
to the second half of the first century BCE. 4Q372 appears to be the
relic of an anti-Samaritan polemical work, antedating the destruction of
the Temple on Mount Gerizim under John Hyrcanus I (134-104 BCE).
No sectarian features are apparent in this writing. It should be noted
that the joint reference to the tribes of Levi, Judah and Benjamin (line
14) is paralleled in 1QM 1, 2. 4Q373, parallel to 2Q22, describes the
battle between a Jewish hero, possibly Moses, and the giant Og, king
of Bashan (cf. Num. xxi, 21—35). The model of the story is the duel
between David and Goliath.

were dispersed in the whole world. All their mountains were deserted
without them ... and fools resided in their land. They made for
themselves a high place on an elevated mountain to excite the jealousy
of Israel. They spoke wor[ds of ... ] of the sons of Jacob and caused
disgust with the words of their mouth, blaspheming against the Tent of
Zion. They spoke [words of falsehood and all the] words of lies to
enrage Levi, Judah and Benjamin by their words. And for all this,
Joseph [was put] into the hands of strangers to consume his strength
and break all his bones until the time of his end. And he cried ... and
called on the mighty God that He should save him from their hands. He
said, ‘My Father and my God, do not abandon me to the hands of the
nations. Execute judgement for me so that the humble and the poor
may not perish. Thou hast no need of any nation or people to help
Thee. [Thy] fing[er] is greater and more powerful than anything in the

violence whatever. Also Thy mercies are many and Thy loving-
kindness is great for all those who seek Thee. [They took] my land from

The Testament of Qahat
(4Q542)
The Testament of Qahat is an Aramaic work of which two columns,
one complete and one damaged, have survived. It is a typical example
of moralizing death-bed literature, similar to the Testaments of the
Twelve Patriarchs, but characterized, like the Testaments of Levi and
Amram, by its priestly perspective. The script has been
palaeographically dated to the end of the second century BCE, but the
carbon 14 test, performed in 1990, places it considerably earlier,
possibly to 388—353 BCE, or more probably to 303—235 BCE. It is
not a sectarian composition. Only the undamaged part of the text is
translated here.
Two further small fragments have survived without providing anything
continuous and meaningful. Fr. 2 alludes to darkness and light, and fr.
3 mentions precious stones extant in large numbers apparently on
account of zenuta (fornication, whoredom).
For the editio princeps, see E. Puech, DJD, XXXI, 257—82.

The Testament of Amram
(4Q543-9)
An Aramaic document surviving in five or six (?) fragmentary copies
from Cave 4 contains an admonition by Amram, the father of Moses, to
his children. The context is that of the Book of Exodus, but the visions
and teachings are the author’s free compositions. Amram’s age at his
death (137 years) is borrowed from Exod. vi, 20, but its dating to the
152nd year of the captivity reflects the tradition according to which the
Israelites remained in Egypt, not for 430 years (Exod. xii, 40), nor 400
years (Gen. xv, 13), but 210 years. Cf. J. Heinemann,
‘210 Years of Egyptian Exile’, JJS 22 (1971), 19—30. The dating of
the script varies between the second half of the second century BCE
(4Q543, 544, 547), the first half of the first century BCE (4Q545, 546)
and the second half of the first century BCE (4Q548, 549).
In the gravely damaged text of a vision, Amram sees the chief Angel
of Darkness, Melkiresha‘, already mentioned (pp. 394—5). He also
addresses the leader of the Army of Light, whose name has
disappeared in one of the many lacunae. But is is highly probable that
one of his ’three names’ is Melchizedek (see pp. 532—4).

The Words of Moses
(1Q22)
Fragments of four very mutilated columns of a manuscript from Cave I
have been skilfully reconstructed by J. T. Milik. They form a farewell
discourse of Moses which takes its inspiration from various passages
of Deuteronomy and is chiefly remarkable for the emphasis laid on the
appointment of special teachers, or interpreters, of the Law (Levites
and Priests). The last two columns are so mutilated as to be
untranslatable. Another document, consisting of two insignificant
fragments, tentatively entitled ‘A Moses Apocryphon’ (2Q21) and
including a prayer attributed to Moses, has been published by J. T.
Milik (DJD, III, 79-81).
For the editio princeps, see J. T. Milik, DYD, I, 91—7.
I [God spoke] to Moses in the [fortieth] year after [the children of] Israel
had come [out of the land of] Egypt, in the eleventh month, on the first
day of the month, saying:
‘[Gather together] all the congregation and go up to [Mount Nebo]
and stand [there], you and Eleazar son of Aaron. Inter[pret to the
heads] of family of the Levites and to all the [Priests], and proclaim to
the children of Israel the words of the law which I proclaimed [to you] on
Mount Sinai. Proclaim care[fully] into their ears all that I [require] of
them. And [call] heaven and [earth to witness against] them; for they will
not love what I have commanded [them to do], neither [they] nor their
children, [during all] the days they shall [live upon the earth].
[For] I say that they will abandon [Me, and will choose the
abominations of the nations,] their horrors [and their idols. They will
serve] false gods which shall be for them a snare and a pitfall. [They
will sin against the] holy [days], and against the Sabbath and the
Covenant, [and against the commandments] which I command you to


---

## Page 629

keep this day.
[Therefore I will smite] them with a mighty [blow] in the midst of the
land [which they] cross the Jordan [to possess]. And when all the
curses come upon them and catch up with them to destroy them and
[blot] them out, then shall they know that the truth has been [fulfilled] with
regard to them.’
Then Moses called Eleazar son of [Aaron] and Joshua [son of Nun
and said to them,] ‘Speak [all these words to the people] ... :
[Be still,] II O Israel, and hear! This [day shall you become the
people] of God, your [God. You shall keep My laws] and My
testimonies [and My commandments which I] command you to [keep
this] day. [And when you] cross the [Jordan so that I may give] you
great [and good cities], and houses filled with all [pleasant things, and
vines and olives] which [you have not planted, and] wells which you
have not dug, [beware,] when you have eaten and are full, that your
hearts be not lifted up, and that [you do not forget what I have
commanded you to do this day. For] it is this that will bring you life and
length of [days].’
And Moses [spoke to the children] of Israel [and said to them]:
‘[Behold,] forty [years have passed since] the day we came out of
the land [of Egypt, and today has God], our God, [uttered these words]
from out of His mouth: [all] His [precepts and] all [His] precepts.
‘[But how shall I carry] your loads [and burdens and disputes alone]?
When I have [established] the Covenant and commanded [the way] in
which you shall walk, [appoint wise men whose] work it shall be to
expound [to you and your children] all these words of the Law. [Watch
carefully] for your own sakes [that you keep them, lest] the wrath [of
your God] kindle and burn against you, and He stop the heavens above
from shedding rain [upon you], and [the water beneath the earth from]
giving you [harvest].’
And Moses [spoke further] to the children of Israel. ‘Behold the
commandments [which God has] commanded you to keep ...’

A Moses Apocryphon
(4Q375)
In a style imitating the Pentateuch, and recalling the Sayings of Moses
from Cave 1 (1Q22), 4Q375, fr. 1, col. I lays down instructions
regarding the treatment of a person who claims to be a prophet.
Should he exhort people to commit apostasy, he is to be executed.
However, his tribe may come to his rescue and lodge an appeal with
the anointed priest in the city of the sanctuary. The very damaged col.
11 contains a sacrificial ritual employing the terminology of the Day of
Atonement from Lev. xvi. The script is early Herodian, i.e. late first
century BCE.
For the editio princeps,see John Strugnell, DJD, XIX, 111—19.
Fr. 1
I ... [You will do all that] your God has commanded you from the mouth
of the prophet. You will keep [all] these [pre]cepts and you will return to

midst, turning you away from your God, shall be put to death. But if the
tribe from which he originates stands up (for him) and says, ‘Let him
not be put to death, for he is righteous; he is a [trus]tworthy prophet’,
you, your elders and your judges will come with that tribe [t]o the place
which your God will choose within one of your tribes (to appear) before
[the] anointed priest on whose head the oil of anointing has been
poured.

A Moses Apocryphon
(4Q376, 1Q29)
This mid-first-century BCE text, which partly overlaps with 1Q29, is a
reworking of Exod. xxviii, 9—12, dealing with the two engraved stones
set in the shoulder pieces of the high priest’s liturgical garment (the
ephod). Another fragment introduces the secular head of the
community, the ‘Prince of the whole congregation’ (cf. 1QM v,1; CD VII,
20, etc.) in his military role, confronting the enemies of Israel or
attacking one of their towns.
For the editio princeps, see John Strugnell, DJD, XIX, 121—36.

Apocryphal Pentateuch B (formerly ‘A Moses
c’
Apocryphon )
(4Q377)
This is part of an apocryphal account of the story of the Israelites at
Sinai and in the wilderness. Fragment 2 ii introduces an elder called
Elibah, who curses the Jews who fail to observe the Law mediated by
Moses during the latter’s stay with God on the mountain.
For the editio princeps, see J. VanderKam and M. Brady, DJD,
XXVIII, 205—17.
Fr. 2 ii
II ... they will understand the precepts of Moses. And Elibah answered
and said: Hearken, congregation of the Lord, and listen, all the
assembly! ... Cursed be the man who does not stand by, keep and
prac[tise] all the comman[dments of the L]ord (issued) by the mouth of
Moses, His anointed, and follow the Lord, the God of our fathers, He
who commanded us from the mountain of Sinai. And He spoke to the
people of Israel face to face as a man speaks to his friend ... He made
us look at a consuming fire from under the heaven. And on the earth,
He stood on the mountain to make it known that there is no god beside
Him and no rock like Him. [And all] the assembly ... and trembling
seized them because of the glory of God and the marvellous voices ...
and they stood at a distance. And Moses the man of God (was) with
God in the cloud and the cloud covered him. For ... when he was
hallowed and out of His mouth he spoke like an angel. For who is a

A Moses (or David) Apocryphon
(4Q373, 2Q22)
Three small Cave 4 fragments which partly overlap with 2Q22
published by M. Baillet (DJD, III, 81—2) represent a historical narrative
of an unnamed speaker in the first person, and with the single actual
name of Og, king of Bashan (cf. Num. xxi, 33—5; Deut. iii, 4—5, 11).
Baillet and the editor of 4Q373, Eileen Schuller, wonder whether the
narrator is David and the subject is his fight with Goliath, a theory
based on a few verbal similarities to 1 Samuel xvii, which cannot,
however, easily account for the mention of Og, apart from his height
(see Deut. iii, 11) which was comparable to that of the giant Goliath (cf.
1 Sam. xvii, 4). S. Talmon, on the other hand, has argued that the topic
of the fragment is more likely to be the defeat of Og by Moses, richly
elaborated by Targum, Midrash and Talmud (cf. L. Ginzberg, The
Legends of the JewsI, 160; III, 340—47; V, n. 181; VI, 667-8, 684—
700). On the whole, the second alternative seems slightly preferable.
For the editio princeps, see E. Schuller and M. Bernstein, DJD,
XXVIII, 199—204.

Prophecy of Joshua
(4Q522, 5Q9)
Two mutilated columns, as well as several further small fragments, of a
narrative appear to describe the future conquest and/or division of the
Holy Land. It appears to be related to the extremely fragmentary 5Q9,
published by J. T. Milik in DJD, III, 179—80, which mentions the name
of Joshua. Col. 1 of 4Q522 consists of a list of localities, of which a
number appear in Joshua xv—xxi (e.g. Beer Sheba, Bealoth, Keilah,
Adullam, etc.) and Judges i (Ashkelon, Kitron). Col. 11 predicts the
conquest of Zion by David and the building of the Temple. In col. 11, 4
and 7 God is referred to in the third person, but in lines 9—10 he
seems to be the speaker.
For the editio princeps of 4Q522, see E. Puech, DJD, XXV, 39—
74.

A Joshua Apocryphon (i) or Psalms of Joshua
(4Q378—9)
Usually designated by the misnomer ‘Psalms of Joshua’, this badly
mutilated composition represents a rewritten account of the story of
Joshua. 4Q378, written in Herodian formal script, consists of twenty-
seven mostly tiny fragments, while the late Hasmonaean 4Q379
comprises forty-one. The majority of the fragments are too small for
meaningful translation. According to Carol Newsom, the overall form of
the composition is a farewell speech by Joshua. It contains
admonitions, curses and prayers (e.g. ‘prayer for our sins’, 4Q378 6 i,
1.4, a prayer listing the twelve tribes of Israel—Levi, Reuben, Gad, and
Dan are legible, 4Q379 1), songs (‘songs of praise’, 4Q379 22 ii, 7,
and a praise mentioning Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Eleazar and
Ithamar, 4Q379 17). The biblical text used recalls the Septuagint and
the Samaritan Pentateuch. The numbering of the fragments appears to
be arbitrary, as it does not correspond to the sequence of the biblical
story. 4Q379 22 ii is quoted in 4QTestimonia (4Q175).

A Joshua Apocryphon (ii) (Masada 1039—211)
Two fragments detached from an apocryphal account of the end of the
Book of Joshua are thought by their editor, S. Talmon, to have
originated at Qumran. The composition belongs to the genre of
‘rewritten Bible’ and testifies to a freedom in retelling scriptural stories.
The handwriting places the manuscript towards the turn of the era.
For a preliminary edition, see Shemaryahu Talmon, ‘Fragments of a
Joshua Apocryphon—Masada 1039—211 (final photo 5254)’, JJS 47
(1996), 128—39.

The Samuel Apocryphon
(4Q160)
Fragments of an account of the story of Samuel from Cave 4 (4Q160),
said to pertain to the second century BCE, were published by J. M.
Allegro. They follow the first book of Samuel and include a narrative
passage, a dialogue between Samuel and Eli, a prayer and an
autobiographical discourse.
For the editio princeps, see J. M. Allegro and A. A. Anderson,
DJD,V, 9—11.

A Paraphrase on Kings
(4Q382)
154 papyrus fragments, palaeographically dated to the first half of the
first century BCE, belong to a kind of paraphrase of the Books of
Kings as various personal names (Jezebel, Ahab, Obadiah, Elijah,
Elisha) clearly indicate. Only one fragment is extensive enough to allow
intelligible translation. An unidentified speaker recounts events
pertaining to the history of Israel in the form of an address to God.

An Elisha Apocryphon

Three minute fragments reproduce the Hebrew text of 2 Kings ii, 14—

up’ are without biblical parallel.
For the editio princeps, see J. Trebolle, DJD, XXII, 305—9.
Fr. 2
... [And] Elisha went up. [When the sons of the prophets who were over
at Jericho] saw [him over against them, they said, The spirit of Elijah

A Zedekiah Apocryphon
(4Q470)
Three badly damaged fragments of an early Herodian manuscript
speak in favourable terms of the last Judaean king Zedekiah. He is
depicted as conversing with the archangel Michael who promises to
make a covenant with him. The Bible is less kind towards this evil-doer
(2 Kgs xxiv, 19, etc.), but 4Q470 prefigures Josephus, who praises
Zedekiah’s ‘goodness and sense of justice’ (Antiquities X, 120), and
the Talmud (bShab. 149b; bSanh. 103a; bArak. 17a).

A Historico-theological Narrative based on
Genesis and Exodus
(4Q462—4)
Palaeographically dated to the mid-first century BCE, the two joined
fragments of 4Q462 represent the only meaningful part of a historical
narrative told from a theological point of view. Both the beginning and
the end of each of the nineteen lines are missing, but the general tenor
of the story can be guessed: after repeated oppression and
humiliation, God is to remember Jerusalem. The Tetragram is twice
replaced by four dots as in the Community Rule (1QS) VIII, 15. There
are six further small fragments.
For the editio princeps of 4Q462, see M. Smith, DJD, XIX, 195—
209. 4Q463, or Narrative D, contains only a few broken lines, starting
with ‘And God remembered his word which he said’, followed by the
quotation of Lev. xxvi, 44. Apparently the fragment has vanished and
the text edited by M. Smith (ibid., 211-14) is based on J. Strugnell’s
transcription. The poorly preserved 4Q464 (ibid., 215—3 2) refers to
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and apparently to Joseph. Fr. 3 ii, 7 contains
the word pesher (interpretation), suggesting that an exegetical
comment followed in the lacuna.

Tobit
(4Q196—200
Prior to the Qumran finds, the Book of Tobit existed among the
Apocrypha in two, a long and a short, Greek recensions and in various
secondary ancient versions. Cave 4 has revealed remains of four
Aramaic (4Q196—9) and one Hebrew (4Q200) manuscripts, of which
two scrolls, the papyrus Toba (196) and the leather Tobb (197), have
yielded copious extracts. They all basically represent the Semitic
original from which the longer Greek recension, attested by the fourth-
century CE Codex Sinaiticus, and the Old Latin version were made.
Toba, Tobc and Tobd are palaeographically dated to the first century
BCE and Tobb, as well as the Hebrew Tobe, to the turn of the era (30
BCE-20 CE). The translation of a composite Aramaic text is followed
separately by that of the Hebrew fragments. The Aramaic and the
Hebrew overlap only in Tob. xiv, 1—2. Of the two, the Aramaic,
represented by older and more numerous manuscripts, is likely to be
the original language of the composition.
The following illustrate some of the differences between the Aramaic
(A), and the Greek (G) Tobit:
i, 22 (A) He was the son of my brother, of my father’s house and of
my family. (G) He was my brother’s son and of my kindred.
ii, 1 (A) On the day of the Festival of Weeks (G) At the feast of
Pentecost which is the sacred festival of the seven weeks
vi, 6 (A) Also he salted the rest for the journey. Both of them were
going together (G) and left part of it salted. And they journeyed
both of them together

Apocryphon of Jeremiah
(4Q383, 385a, 387, 387a, 388a, 389—90)
Originally considered as part of an Ezekiel apocryphon, the remains of
these manuscripts, written in a well-imitated biblical Hebrew, have
been identified by the editor as pertaining to an apocryphal account of
the life of Jeremiah in Babylon and in Egypt. The script probably dates
to the end of the first century
BCE.
For the editio princeps, see D. Dimant, DJD, XXX, 91—260. For
the related 4Q384, see M. Smith, DJD, XIX, 136—52.

I vacat ... Jeremiah the Prophet [departed] from before the Lord
(YHWH) ... [to accompany the] captives who were taken captive from
the land of Jerusalem and came [to ... Nebuchadnezzar,] king of Babel,
when Nabuzaradan, the chief of the bodyguard, smote ... and took the
vessels of the house of God, the priests ... and the sons of Israel and
led them to Babel. And Jeremiah the Prophet went [with them as far
as] the river and he commanded them what they were to do in the land
of [their] captivity ... [And they obeyed] the voice of Jeremiah in regard
to the words which God commanded him ... and they were to keep the
covenant of the God of their fathers in the land [of their captivity ... and
they were not to d]o as they had done and their kings and priests [and
... and they] profaned [the na]me of God ...

The New Jerusalem
(4Q554-5, 5Q15, 1Q32, 2Q24, 4Q232, 11Q18)
Fragments belonging to an Aramaic writing describing the Jerusalem
of the eschatological age have been identified in Caves 1 (1Q32), 2
(2Q24), 4 (4Q554—5), 5 (5Q15) and 11 (11Q18). There are also
Hebrew fragments listed under 4Q232.
They are all inspired by Ezekiel xl-xlviii (cf. also Revelation xxi). On
palaeographical considerations, the manuscripts are thought to date to
around the turn of the era.
The visionary responsible for this work accompanies an angelic
‘surveyor’ who measures everything in the New Jerusalem, from the
size of the blocks of houses, the avenues and the streets, to the
detailed dimensions of rooms, stairs and windows. The dimensions
are given in ‘reeds’, each of which consists of seven ‘cubits’. But there
seem to have been two cubits in use as ancient Jewish
measurements, one approximately 20 inches (52 1 mm), the other 18
inches (446 mm) long.
For the editio princeps, see J. T. Milik, DJD, III, 184-93. For smaller
fragments, see Milik, DJD, I, 134-5; M. Baillet, DJD, III, 84-90; E.

houses, a street gallery, three reeds = 21 cubits, (wide).
[He] then [showed me the di]mensions of [all] the blo[cks of houses.
Between each block there is a street], six reeds = 42 cubits, wide. And
the width of the avenues running from east to west: two of them are ten
reeds = 70 cubits, wide. And the third, that to the [lef]t (i.e. north) of the
Temple, measures eighteen reeds =126 cubits in width. And the wid[th
of the streets] running from south [to north: t]wo of [them] have nine
reeds and four cubits = 67 cubits, each street.
[And the] mid[dle street passing through the mid]dle of the city, its

[And he] le[d m]e [be]yond the threshold. [And behold] another
threshold, and a door next to the inner wall [on the right side, of the
same dimensions as the outer door. Its width] is four [cu]bits, [its]
height seven [cubits], and it has two wings. And in front of this door
there is [an entrance threshold. Its width is one reed] = 7 II [cubits]. And
the l[eng]th of the entrance is two reeds = 14 cubits, and its height is
two reeds = 14 cubits. [And the door] fa[cing the other do]or opening
into the block of houses has the same dimensions as the outer door.
On the left of this entrance, he showed [me] a round [staircase]. Its
length is of the same dimension as its width: two reeds by two =14

same dimensions. And a pillar is inside the staircase around which the
stairs ri[se]; its width and d[epth are six cubits by six], a square. And
the stairs which rise beside it, their width is four cubits, and they rise in
a spiral [to] a height of [two] r[eeds] to [the roof].
And he led me [into] the block of houses, and he showed me the
houses there. From one door to the oth[er, there are fifteen: eigh]t on
one side as far as the corner, and seven from the corner to the other
door. The length of the house[s is three reed]s = 2[1 cubits, and their

Pseudo-Ezekiel
(4Q385, 386, 385b, 388, 385c)
An apocryphal work, modelled on the Book of Ezekiel, has survived in
five Cave 4 manuscripts. It consists of exchanges between God and
the prophet, who is several times named. The eschatological material
of 4Q385 includes, among others, Ezekiel’s vision of the dry bones
and the Chariot passage. On the basis of its script, 4Q385 is dated to
the late Hasmonaean or early Herodian era, i.e. roughly to mid-first
century BCE. There is nothing obviously sectarian in the document.
4Q386 also deals with the vision of the dry bones (Ezek. xxxvii) and the
future of the land of Israel. 4Q385b is built on Ezekiel’s prophecy
against Egypt (Ezek. xxx, 1-3) and 4Q388 alludes once more to the dry
bones and the final battle. 4Q385c consists of seven unidentified
scraps.

The Prayer of Nabonidus
(4Q242)
While the Book of Daniel (iv) writes of the miraculous recovery of
Nebuchadnezzar after an illness which lasted seven years, this
interesting Aramaic composition tells a similar story about the last king
of Babylon, Nabonidus. The principal difference between the two is
that Nebuchadnezzar was cured by God Himself when he recognized
His sovereignty, whereas a Jewish exorcist healed Nabonidus by
teaching him the truth and forgiving his sins. J. T. Milik considers the
work to be older than Daniel, but a late second or early first-century
BCE dating seems to be less adventurous (cf. ‘Prière de Nabonide et
autres écrits d’un cycle de Daniel’, RB 63 (1956), 407-11). Cf. also G.
Vermes, Jesus the Jew, London, 1973, 67-8.

I was afflicted [with an evil ulcer] for seven years ... and an exorcist
pardoned my sins. He was a Jew from [among the children of the exile
of Judah, and he said], ‘Recount this in writing to [glorify and exalt] the
name of the [Most High God’. And I wrote this]:
‘I was afflicted with an [evil] ulcer in Teiman [by decree of the Most
High God]. For seven years [I] prayed to the gods of silver and gold,
[bronze and iron], wood and stone and clay, because [I believed] that
they were gods ... ’

Para-Danielic Writings
(4Q243-5)
In addition to the Prayer of Nabonidus, Cave 4 has revealed further
Aramaic remains of a composition akin to the biblical Book of Daniel,
with three explicit mentions of the name Daniel, who appears to be the
narrator of the story. Another personality, Balakros, figures in 4Q243.
J. T. Milik tentatively identified him with the Seleucid ruler Alexander
Balas, the patron of Jonathan Maccabaeus. One of the fragments of
4Q245 represents a list of priests, including possibly the Maccabee
brothers, Jonathan and Simon, and kings. The remaining pieces are
too small for translation.

The Four Kingdoms
(4Q552-3)
Partly overlapping remains of two manuscripts of an Aramaic work
further testify to the existence of a rich para-Danielic literature. These
poorly preserved documents allude to the story of the four empires
(Dan. vii-viii) in the form of a metaphor of four trees.
For the editio princeps, see E. Puech, DJD,XXXVII (forthcoming).

An Aramaic Apocalypse
(4Q246)
Surnamed the ‘Son of God fragment’, 4Q246, with its intriguing
phrases ‘son of God’ and ‘son of the Most High‘, recalling Luke i, 32,
35, has been in the centre of learned and popular speculation. On
palaeographical grounds the script is dated to the final decades of the
first century BCE. Four competing interpretations of the ‘son of God’
figure have been proposed: the title is to be associated with the
Seleucid ruler, Alexander Balas (J. T. Milik); it designates a Jewish,
possibly Hasmonaean, king, with a possible ‘messianic undertone’ in
the use of ‘son of God’ (J. A. Fitzmyer); the Antichrist (D. Flusser); still
apocalyptically, but in a positive sense, F. García Martínez argued in
favour of an angelic identity, the ‘son of God’ is either the heavenly
Melchizedek or Michael, the Prince of Light. The editor has decided to
sit on the fence and applies the title to either the future Davidic
Messiah or a historical Seleucid pretender.
The overall message of the fragment recalls the apocalyptic section
of the Book of Daniel. A Daniel-like person, referred to in column 1, is
to explain to a king seated on a throne a vision or dream alluding to
wars involving Assyria and Egypt, and the arrival of a final ruler, served
by all, and called by them, or designating himself, ‘son of God’. But the
triumph of peace is not attributed to him - his reign is rather
characterized by internecine struggle between nations and provinces -
but to the Great God, helping ‘the people of God’ (cf. Dan. vii, 22, 29),
whose dominion over mankind is declared eternal (cf. Dan. vii, 14) and
free from the sword.
Relying mainly on the evidence of the existing text, rather than on
hypothetical reconstructions of missing passages, I see in the ‘son of
God’ of 4Q246 neither Flusser’s Antichrist, nor the straight historical
individual of the Milik-Puech variety, but the last historico-apocalyptic

Proto-Esther (?)
(4Q550)
A number of badly damaged fragments of an Aramaic writing report
events said to have occurred in the Persian court, thus recalling the
biblical story of Esther. The script is dated to the second half of the first
century BCE. J. T. Milik, in a very learned, but equally conjectural,
manner, has reconstructed the background of the narrative, even
restoring the name of Esther from an incomplete word beginning with
the letters aleph and samekh. He has thus discovered an Aramaic
model of Esther at Qumran, although no remains of the canonical
Book of Esther have so far been found there. K. Beyer entitles the
writing as Documents of Darius and classifies it as a legendary
account relating to Darius I and Xerxes, kings of Persia, who
apparently worshipped the God of the Jews.
For the editio princeps, see E. Puech, DJD, XXXVII (forthcoming).

List of False Prophets
(4Q339)
This is a brief list of false prophets, recorded in Aramaic and
palaeographically Herodian in date. The first six names come from the
Bible. The last two lines are completed by the editor as ‘[Hananiah son
of Az]ur’ (Jer. xxviii, 1) and ‘[a prophet from Gib]eon‘, interpreted as the
continuation of the description of Hananiah (see ibid.). One may object
to this reconstruction that all the previous names occupy a single line.
The name of Yohanan ben Shim’on, i.e. John Hyrcanus I, son of Simon
Maccabaeus, has been suggested by A. Rofe and E. Qimron.
Hyrcanus I was thought to have been endowed with prophetic gifts (cf.
Josephus, Jewish War I, 68-9; Antiquities XIII, 300), but the anti-
Hasmonaean Qumran sect would have condemned him as a false
prophet. This identification is distinctly possible, but owing to the
fragmentary state of the line the reading is purely conjectural.

The Copper Scroll
(3Q15)
The Copper Scroll (3Q15), which has stimulated much curiosity and
speculation, was found by archaeologists in Cave 3 during the
excavations of 1952, but the metal had become so badly oxidized
during the course of the centuries that the scroll could not be unfolded.
It was therefore sent to Professor H. Wright Baker of the Manchester
College of Science and Technology who, in 1956, carefully divided it
into longitudinal strips and, in the same year, returned it to Jordan. It is
part of the treasures of the Archaeological Museum of Amman. The
Hebrew text, representing twelve columns of script, was published by
J. T. Milik in 1962. It was preceded by a less trustworthy edition by J.
M. Allegro, The Treasure of the Copper Scroll, London, 1960.
The inscription lists sixty-four hiding-places, in Jerusalem and in
various districts of Palestine, where gold, silver, Temple offerings,
scrolls, etc., are said to have been deposited. Allegro reckoned that
the treasure amounted to over three thousand talents of silver, nearly
one thousand three hundred talents of gold, sixty-five bars of gold, six
hundred and eight pitchers containing silver, and six hundred and
nineteen gold and silver vessels. In other words, using the post-biblical
value of the talent as a yard-stick, the total weight of precious metal
must have added up to sixty-five tons of silver and twenty-six tons of
gold.
Who could have possessed such a fortune? Was there ever any
truth in it?
The answer is in the negative, according to J. T. Milik. In his view,
the exaggerated sums indicate that the scroll is a work of fiction and
that its chief interest to scholars lies in the fields of linguistics and
topography. He dates it from about 100 CE, thus ruling out any
connection with the rest of the Qumran writings since the latter were


---

## Page 680

placed in the caves not later than 68 CE.
The treasure was a real one according to other scholars,
representing the fortune of the Essenes (A. Dupont-Sommer, S.
Goranson) or the Temple treasure (J. M. Allegro, N. Golb, A. Wolters).
According to Allegro, the Zealots were responsible for the
concealment of the gold and silver and for the writing of the scroll. It
has also been suggested that we are dealing here with funds collected
for the rebuilding of the Temple after 70 CE, or with the hidden
treasure of Bar Kokhba, leader of the second Jewish revolution
against Rome in 132-5 CE.
Milik’s argument would certainly seem to account for the vast
quantities of treasure mentioned. It does not, however, explain two of
the document’s most striking characteristics, namely, the dry realism of
its style, very different from that of ancient legends, and the fact that it
is recorded on copper instead of on the less expensive leather or
papyrus. For if it is, in fact, a sort of fairy-story, the present text can only
represent the outline of such a tale, and who in their senses would
have engraved their literary notes on valuable metal?
The contention that the treasure was a real one is supported by the
very arguments which undermine Milik’s. From the business-like
approach, and the enduring material on which the catalogue is
inscribed, it might sensibly be supposed that the writer was not
indulging some frivolous dream. Again, in view of the fact that the
Copper Scroll was found among writings known to come from Qumran,
Dupont-Sommer and Goranson would appear justified in allocating the
fortune to the Essenes. It requires, by comparison, a strong feat of the
imagination to accept that all this wealth belonged originally to the
treasure chambers of the Temple, and that it was placed in hiding, in a
hostile environment, in 68 CE, before, that is to say, there was any
immediate danger to the capital city of Jerusalem. Allegro bypassed
this objection by presuming that, as Qumran was by then in the hands
of the Zealots, it was no longer unfriendly to the Jerusalem authorities.
But it has not yet been explained why the sack of the Temple and city
should have been foreseen, and provided for, so early. In favour of the
Temple treasure hypothesis, it is nevertheless possible to envisage
that the Jerusalem sanctuary possessed such riches as these,


---

## Page 681

whereas, despite Dupont-Sommer’s undoubtedly true remarks
concerning the apparent compatibility of religious poverty and fat
revenues, it is still hard to accept that the Essenes, a relatively small
community, should have amassed such disproportionate wealth.
This is all that can safely be said of the Copper Scroll at the present
time. Further study of the original will allow scholars to improve many of
the readings. Meanwhile students of Qumran are considerably in J. T.
Milik’s debt for his pioneering decipherment of an extremely difficult
text.

have been assembled under the tide 4Q249. The editor, S. J. Pfann,
has subdivided them into several units, the most important of which are
The Midrash on the Book ofMoses(4Q249) and the cryptic Messianic
Rule (4Q249a-i) reconstructed on the basis of 1QSa. The remainder
(4Q249j-z; 250a-j; 313a-b) are mostly unidentified. The pieces are so
small that they possess no independent significance. Even in the case
of twenty-two fragments of the Messianic Rule the reconstruction
presumes that the text of the Cave 1 manuscript is ‘canonical’. Should
it, like most other Qumran manuscripts, lack definite wording, the
placement of the unconnected tiny scraps would become uncertain.
The dating of the script of the Messianic Rule to the middle of the
second century BCE is also highly questionable. It cannot have been
written before the Community Rule and the Damascus Document and
very likely belongs to the mid-first century BCE.
For the editio princeps, see S. J. Pfann, DJD, XXXV, 1-24; DJD,
XXXVI, 515-701.
4Q249 i
(The letters in italics indicate the surviving text. The rest is hypothetical
reconstruction. The examples below are meant to illustrate the nature
of the conjectures. The presumed subject is leprosy and the cleansing
of garments and of the house; cf. Leviticus xiv.)

Two Qumran Ostraca
In the spring of 1996 two Hebrew ostraca were found by Professor
James F. Strange of the University of South Florida. They were
discovered in the base of the eastern face of the wall separating the
community centre from the cemetery. The script is dated to the first
century CE.
For the editio princeps, see F. M. Cross and E. Eshel, DJD, XXXVI,
497-508.96
Ostracon no. 1
1. In year two of the [...]
2. in Jericho, Honi son of [ ] gave
3. to ‘El’azar son of Nahmani [ ]
4. Hisday from Holon [ ]
5. from this day to perpetui[ty]
6. the boundaries of the house and [ ]
7. and the fig trees, the ol[ive tree (?), and ]
8. when he fulfilled (his oath) to the Community (?) [ ]

11. and the [ ]
12. And into the hand of [ ]
13. [ ]
14. Hisday servant of H[oni (?) ]
15. Holon
The text documents the gift of a slave, together with an estate and
produce. Reference is made to fulfilling an oath, or a period of time as
a neophyte, to the Yahad in line 8, using the term kml(‘)wtw lyhd, ‘when
he fulfilled (his oath) to the Community’. This terminology resembles


---

## Page 690

that of the Community Rule (1QS vi), and as such may hint that this
ostracon is a draft of an accounting (heshbon) of the Overseer.97 The
proposed reading, especially in lines 4 and 8, has been queried by
various scholars, Ada Yardeni among them (‘A Draft Deed on an
Ostracon from Khirbet Qumran‘, IEJ 47 (1997), 233-7). According to
Yardeni, instead of ‘Hisday from Holon’ (’t Hsdy mHwln) one should
read ‘these sackcloths’ (’t hsqym hllw), and instead of ‘when he fulfilled
(his oath) to the Community’ (wkmlwttw lyhd), ‘and every other tree’
(wkwl ’yln ‘hr). The damaged cursive script of the ostracon being what
it is, Ada Yardeni’s readings are perfectly possible. Nevertheless
‘sackcloths’ at the head of a list of valuable gifts is quite out of place.
Also, whereas the editors’ yhd (Community) is questionable, their
interpretation regarding the handing-over of personal property to the
sect is supported by the absence of any indication of family
relationship between the donor and recipient. Normally, a free gift, i.e.
with no exchange of money, presupposes close family links, for
example a gift from father to daughter.
Ostracon no. 2
A second ostracon, written by a different hand of the same period,
reads:
1. (?)
2. (?)
3. [Jose]ph son of Nathna[el...]
4. his [s]ons from ‘En Gedi(?)

I. Appendix
Scroll Catalogue
Perhaps the greatest disservice rendered to scholarship by Roland de
Vaux and his successors resulted from their obstinate refusal to
release the list of the unpublished texts from Caves 4 and 11.
‘Outsiders’ were not only denied access to them but were not even
allowed to know what exactly they were not permitted to see! We had
to wait until the spring of 1992 for Emanuel Tov, editor-in-chief of the
Dead Sea Scrolls Publication Project since 1990, to correct this
injustice by releasing the long-awaited ‘secrets’ and publishing them,
at my invitation, in the Journal of Jewish Studies. Here follows a
complete inventory of the manuscripts and fragments discovered in the
eleven Qumran caves together with source references for all the
published texts.1 For the final list of all the manuscript finds at Qumran,
the other Judaean caves, Wadi Daliyeh, Khirbet Mird and Masada,
see E. Tov, DJD, XXXLX, 27-114.
NB. A list of the abbreviations used appears on pp. 91-2.

THE STORY OF PENGUIN CLASSICS
Before 1946 ...‘Classics’ are mainly the domain of academics and
students, without readable editions for everyone else. This all changes
when a little-known classicist, E. V. Rieu, presents Penguin founder
Allen Lane with the translation of Homer’s Odyssey that he has been
working on and reading to his wife Nelly in his spare time.
1946 The Odyssey becomes the first Penguin Classic published, and
promptly sells three million copies. Suddenly, classic books are no
longer for the privileged few.
1950s Rieu, now series editor, turns to professional writers for the best
modern, readable translations, including Dorothy L. Sayers’s Inferno
and Robert Graves’s The Twelve Caesars, which revives the
salacious original.
1960s The Classics are given the distinctive black jackets that have
remained a constant throughout the series’s various looks. Rieu retires
in 1964, hailing the Penguin Classics list as ‘the greatest educative
force of the 20th century’.
1970s A new generation of translators arrives to swell the Penguin
Classics ranks, and the list grows to encompass more philosophy,
religion, science, history and politics.
1980s The Penguin American Library joins the Classics stable, with
titles such as The Last of the Mohicans safeguarded. Penguin
Classics now offers the most comprehensive library of world literature
available.


---

## Page 791

1990s The launch of Penguin Audiobooks brings the classics to a
listening audience for the first time, and in 1999 the launch of the
Penguin Classics website takes them online to a larger global
readership than ever before.
The 21st Century Penguin Classics are rejacketed for the first time in
nearly twenty years. This world famous series now consists of more
than 1300 titles, making the widest range of the best books ever
written available to millions - and constantly redefining the meaning of
what makes a ‘classic’.
The Odyssey continues ...

The following brief account of the Huntington Library’s involvement with
the Dead Sea Scrolls is based on documentary evidence kindly
provided by its President, Robert A. Skotheim. In 1982, Elizabeth Hay
Bechtel, a renowned Californian philanthropist and Scroll Maecenas,
deposited at the Huntington a set of negatives of Qumran manuscripts.
These had been taken in 1980 by Robert Schlosser, the chief
photographer of the library, for whom Mrs Bechtel obtained permission
from the Jerusalem Department of Antiquities to photograph all the
Dead Sea Scrolls. Two series of pictures were produced, one for the
Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center founded by Mrs Bechtel in
Claremont, California, and another for herself. The latter ended up in a
‘climatized’ vault specially constructed at the Huntington with the help
of a Bechtel grant of $50,000. In 1986, a year before her death, Mrs
Bechtel donated her Scroll photographs to the Huntington. Paragraph
9 of the agreement made in April 1982 specifies that materials on
which no restrictive policy is applied by Mrs Bechtel ‘will be made


---

## Page 795

available to use by scholars in accordance with the Huntington’s
general policies for its own materials’. No such restriction was ever
conveyed by her to the trustees of the library. Bill Moffett became
director of the Library in 1990. It was on the basis of clause 9 of the
agreement that he proposed to the trustees the opening of the
Huntington’s Qumran photographs to all qualified users of the library.
Bill Moffett, the ‘liberator of the Scrolls’, died on 20 February 1995 at
the age of sixty-two.

It is suggested that the Aramaic fragments of 4Q550 derive from a

4Q242-6 testify to the existence of a non-canonical Daniel cycle.

Josephus never presents a full picture of the Jewish scene of his time

to the Essenes. Cf. ‘A Note on the Qumran Sectarians, the Essenes

Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls? - The Search for the Meaning of

Centre’s Forum for Qumran Research, although the facts
misinterpreted by Professor Golb (first in The Qumran Chronicle 2/1,
1992, 3-25) have been set out correctly by G. Vermes and P.
Alexander, ‘Norman Golb and Modern History’ (ibid., 2/2, 1993, 153-6,
with a correction in the same periodical 4/1-2, 1994, 74).
51
At the Scrolls Symposium held at the Library of Congress in
Washington on 21-2 April 1993, Magen Broshi, Director of the Shrine
of the Book at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, delivered a powerful
rebuttal of the Golb conjecture as well as the speculative theory
advanced at another conference, held in New York in December 1992,
by Pauline Donceel-Voûte, in whose view Qumran was a winter villa
built for wealthy inhabitants of Jerusalem and the room which de Vaux
identified as a scriptorium a dining hall (see ‘Coenaculum’, Res
Orientales IV (1992), 61-84). Against the latter theory, see R. Reich, ‘A
Note on the Function of Room 30 (the “Scriptorium”) at Khirbet
Qumran’, JJS 46 (1995), 157-60, For P. Donceel-Voûte the Qumran
complex constitutes a country estate, a villa rustica (‘Les ruines de
Qumrân réinterprétées’, Archaeologia 298 (1994), 24-35), and the
same theory is propounded by Yizhar Hirschfeld (‘Early Roman Manor
Houses in Judea and the Site of Khirbet Qumran’, Journal of Near
Eastern Studies 57 (1998), 161-89). According to A. Crown and L.
Cansdale, Qumran was a luxurious hostelry for merchants (‘Qumran:
Was it an Essene Settlement?’, BAR 20, No. 5 (1994), 24-35, 73-8).
The mainstream opinion that the ruins are the remains of an Essene
religious settlement is forcefully maintained by M. Broshi in ‘The
Archaeology of Qumran: A Reconsideration’ and ‘Was Qumran,
indeed, a Monastery?’, in Bread, Wine, Walls and Scrolls, Sheffield
Academic Press (2002), 198-210, 259-73. For the latest and very

Archaeology of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Grand Rapids,

In January 1996, two Israeli archaeologists investigated man-made
caves close to the settlement which, in their opinion, were used as
sleeping quarters by members of the sect. See M. Broshi and H.
Eshel, ‘How and Where Did the Qumranites Live?’, Dead Sea
Discoveries 6 (1999), 328-48.

The absence of any mention of the ‘sons of Zadok, the Priests’ in MMT
deals a serious blow to the hypothesis that a proto-Sadducaean
priestly group lurks behind this document. The basis of this theory is
that three legal doctrines (out of a list of more than twenty) voiced in
MMT are attributed to the Sadducees in rabbinic literature. But the
soundest position is to consider these teachings as priestly halakhot,
held by the forerunners of the Qumran Community and the later
Sadducees.
69
The Therapeutai or Egyptian ascetics of Philo adopted celibacy, but
formed separate male and female communities (mature men having
left behind family and property, and women being mostly aged virgins;
cf. Philo, Contemplative Life, 13, 68) whose members met for
worship. A badly damaged manuscript from Cave 4 (4Q502),


---

## Page 801

repeatedly mentioning old men and women, is interpreted by J. M.
Baumgarten as probably alluding to a similar institution (‘4Q502,
Marriage or Golden Age Ritual?’, JJS 34 (1983), 125-35). 4Q502
consists of 344 papyrus fragments. Its editor, M. Baillet (DJD, VII, 81-
105), gave it the title ‘Marriage Ritual’, which is almost certainly a
misnomer (see Baumgarten above). Not a single coherent section of
this liturgical composition has survived; hence no meaningful
translation can be supplied. However, it is worth noting that fr. 2
contains the phrase ‘daughter of truth’ and an allusion to the
examination of women concerning their ‘intelligence and
understanding’. Josephus states in connection with the marrying
Essenes that they trained their women - like their men - for three years
(War II, 161; cf. G. Vermes, Discovery in the Judean Desert, New
York, 1956, 57, note 176; J. M. Baumgarten, DJD, XVIII, 143).
70
This interpretation of the data yielded by the excavation is that of R. de
Vaux (see Archaeology and the Dead Sea Scrolls, I973). In her
recent brilliant survey, Jodi Magness questions de Vaux’s theory
regarding the first phase of the limited sectarian occupation of the
Qumran site during the second half of the second century BCE and
argues that the communal buildings were first erected around 100
BCE (see The Archaeology of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls,
2002, 63-9). If she is right, the initial edifice was already on a relatively
large scale and would correspond to the needs of an already well-
established group. In fact, her theory is compatible with the early
Hasmonaean beginnings of the sect based on literary considerations,
albeit without supporting archaeological evidence.
71
The Zadokite affiliation of the Teacher of Righteousness may be
supported by circumstantial evidence. According to the older version
of the Community Rule, represented by 4Q258 and 256, the
democratic ‘Congregation’ (‘the Many’) constituted the supreme
authority of the Community with ordinary priests (sons of Aaron)
forming the top layer in doctrinal and legal administration. This position
is attributed to the ‘sons of Zadok’, members of the high-priestly family,
in the revised 1QS v. In other words, at some early stage in the history


---

## Page 802

of the sect there was a Zadokite takeover. Combining this information
with the account of CD 1 (supported by 4QD), we may reasonably
surmise that the change occurred with the arrival of the Teacher of
Righteousness sent by God to take care of the ‘plant’ of Aaron and
Israel (ordinary priests and lay Jews), who had been groping,
leaderless, for twenty years. The crisis in the Zadokite ranks in the
160s BCE, following the secession of Onias IV to Egypt, provides the
likeliest background for these events (cf. G. Vermes, ‘The Leadership
of the Qumran Community’ in Geschichte-Tradition-Reflexion [Martin
Hengel Festschrift] I (Tübingen, 1996, 375-84). In this connection it
may not be irrelevant to note that according to 4Q266 fr. 5 ii priests
who had emigrated among the Gentiles were disqualified.
72
To these four outstanding Essenes we may now add possibly the
name of a Bursar or Guardian, Eleazar son of Nahmani, mentioned in
one of the Qumran ostraca (cf. below, p. 634), and the three imperfect
members, Yohanan and two men called Hananiah mentioned in
4Q477. See above, pp. 31-2.
73
Another metaphorical use of Lebanon (= the foreign nations) is implied
in the quotation of Isa. x, 34 in the Rule of War (4Q285 fr. 5).
74
4Q268 adds: to me.
75

Sword, against my shepherd, against my companion, says God.

Strike the shepherd that tbe flock may be scattered and I will stretch
my hand over the little ones (Zech. xiii, 7). The humble of the flock are
those who watch for Him. They shall be saved at the time of the
Visitation whereas the others shall be delivered up to the sword when
the Anointed of Aaron and Israel shall come, as it came to pass at the
time of the former Visitation concerning which God said by the hand of
Ezekiel: They shall put a mark on tbe forebeads of those who sigh
and groan (Ezek. ix, 4). But the others were delivered up to the
avenging sword of the Covenant.
80
MS. B inserts: they have entered the Covenant of repentance but they
have not turned, etc.
81
MS. B adds: bore witness against the people, so will He love, etc.
82
The end of the Exhortation of CD is followed in 4Q266, fr. 4, lines 11-
12, by a badly preserved allusion to the Messiah: ‘God [will set up] a
shep[herd for His people] and he will feed [them] in [pastures] ...’
