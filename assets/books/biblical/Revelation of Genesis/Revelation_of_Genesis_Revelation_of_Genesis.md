REVELATION OF GENESIS.
In thebeginning God created the heaven
and the earth. And the earth was waste
and void and darkness was upon the
;
face of the deep and the spirit of God
;
moved upon the waters.
The spirit of God is the beginning of
all ; thus it is written in the book of
Moses ; the Lord is the God of all spirits,
and besides the matter of Moses spoken
with God shall not be forgotten, as fol-
lows Moses said unto God Behold,
: :
when I come unto the children of Israel,
and shall say unto them, The God of your
fathers hath sent me unto you and they
;
shall say to me. What is his name ?^ what
shall I say unto them ? And God said
AM THAT AM
unto Moses, I I and
;
he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the

AM
children of Israel, T hath sent me
AM
unto you ; I was the beginning of all,
and thus is the end of all.
After the beginning the waters were on
the face of all deep, and also on the face of
all high they moved. And the spirit of
God moved upon the waters, and thus
elements of fire came amidst the waters,
but were scattering on all face of the deep
and high. And there was light according
to the word of God. And God saw the
light that it was good, and God divided
the light from the darkness. And God
called the light Day and the darkness he
called Night. And there was evening,
and there was morning, one day.
In the beginning of creation there was
evening, but when the light was amidst
the waters thus there was morning
and thereafter the light changed with the
darkness, and evenifig with morning
according to the wisdom of God. Because
of the spirit of God the waters were stir-
ring and thus produced the elements of
fire. And the waters soared with the fires.

On the face of heaven there was no length
and breadth, no height and depth before
man's comprehension, and each of the
elements of water and fire returned to its
place according to God's word. And there
was evening and there was morning, one
day, and thus one day is one Eternity,
Because of the holiness of God the book
Genesis was written by Moses's hand, and
that did not omit nor add anything, but to
the image of God to man it is given from
child to child, to science, to study, to
exploration, to the greatest work that
ever comes before man, to the spiritual
work.
On the Pentateuch in each chapter
this word is written : God created in six
days heaven and earth and the sea and all
that is in them, and rested on the seventh
day.
Before the face of God man was like the
child whose intellect was hidden. And
God being the true father put the man
who was called Adam into a beautiful
garden, and brought unto man the

beasts of the field and the fowls of the
air that he should see them and learn to
give names to them. And also he gave to
man wife. But when man from time to
time received intellect he made sins pur-
suant to God's wisdom, for it was the will
of God that man, the image of God, from
child to child, shall augment intellect, and
that from time to time knowledge and
science shall multiply among men, and
also that man shall learn to distinguish
between good and evil. And God said to
man from time of old, thus it is : Choose
the good and abhor the evil, but God knew
all this also, and in his heart said: The
thought of man's heart is evil from his
youth.
The darkness was in the beginning, but
thereafter the light came, and thus the
man was evil in his vouth, but became
good by his age. Godmade the firmament
and divided the waters which were under
the firmament from the waters which were
above the firmament : and it was so. And
God called the firmament Heaven. And

there was evening, and there was morning,
a second eternity. On the face of heaven
a great many firmaments were created that
are far mightier than the firmament of the
earth, but God had not spoken on that
creation that it was good ; and perhaps it
may be that several firmaments will be
annihilated at the coming time pursuant to
God's thought.
And God said, Let the waters under the
heaven begatheredtogether unto one place,
and let the dry land appear and it was so.
;
And God called the dry land Earth, and
the gathering together of the waters called
he Seas : and God saw that it was good.
And God said. Let the earth put forth
grass, herb yielding seed, and tree bearing
fruit after its kind, wherein is the seed
thereof, upon the earth : and it was so.
And the earth brought forth grass, herb
yielding seed after its kind, and tree bear-
ing fruit, wherein the seed is thereof, after
its kind ; and God saw that it was good.
And there was evening and there was
morning, third eternity. And God said of

the earth, the dwelling of man, that it was
good, even of the third eternity creation,
bat that God saw how the second eteinity
creation was good it was not written in the
book of Moses. Because of his holiness it
was so on the ground that man was not
able to explore the multitude of heaven
firmaments like the earth. This reason
seemed stronger than that reason that from
the multitude of heaven firmaments several
will break in at the coming time.
And God said, Let there be lights in the
firmament of the heaven to divide the day
from the night and let them be for signs,
;
and for seasons, and for days and years
and let them be lights in the firmament of
'heaven to give light upon the earth : and it
was so. And God made the two great
lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the smaller light to rule the night; he
made the stars also. And God set them
in the firmament of the heaven to give
light upon the earth and to rule over the
day and over the night, and to divide the
light from the darkness and God saw that
:

it was good. And there was evening, and
there was morning, fourth eternity.
And God created the great sea monsters
andevery livingcreaturethat moved, which
the waters brought forth abundantly
after their kinds and every winged fowl
;
after its kind and God saw that it was
;
good. And God blessed them, saying, Be
fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters
in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the
earth. And there was evening, and there
was morning, fifth eternity.
And God said. Let the earth bring forth
the livingcreature afterits kind, cattle and
creeping thing, and beast of the earth
after its kind : and it was so. And God
made the beast of the earth after its kind,
and the cattle after their kind, and every-
thing that creeps upon the ground after its
kind; and God saw that it was good.
And God said, Let us make man in our
image after our likeness and let them
;
have dominion over the fish of the sea,
and over the fowl of the air, and over the
cattle, and over all the earth, and over

every creeping thing that creeps upon the
earth.
And God created man in his own image,
in the image of God created he him male
:
and female created he them. And God
blessed them and God said unto them,
:
Be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the
earth and subdue it, and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over every living thing
thatmoves upon the earth. And God said,
Behold, I have given you every herb
yielding seed, which is upon the face of all
the earth, and every tree and every
fruit of the tree yielding seed ; to you it
shall be for food and to every beast of the
;
earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to
everything that creeps upon the earth,
wherein there is living soul, I have given
every green herb for food ; and it was so.
And God saw everything that he had
made, and, behold, it was very good. And
there was evening, and there was morning,
sixth eternity.
And the heaven and the earth were fin-

ished; and all the host of them. And on
the seventh day God finished his work
which he had made, and he rested on the
seventh day from all his work which he
had made. And God blessed the seventh
day and hallowed it, because in it he rested
from all his work which God had created
and made.
God created the heaven and the earth
and all their host in six eternities, and
rested on the seventh eternity. And
when God created all them, there was a
great deal of pain and sorrow in the
spirit of God which man from generation
to generation shall never be able to com-
prehend thereof. And after God had
created man in his image, after his like-
ness, he rested on the seventh eternity, for
he saw how the creation of man was very
good.
The heaven, and the earth, and all their
host were created from the first eternity
until second eternity connectedly, and
thus from second eternity until third
eternity connectedly, and from third

eternity until fourth eternity connectedly,
and from fourth eternityuntil fifth eternity
connectedly, and from fifth eternity until
sixth eternity connectedly, and on the
seventh eternity God rested from all work
that he had made. And God blessed the
seventh eternity and hallowed it, for before
God it was there written that the heaven
and the earth and all the host of them
were very good. The creation of man in
God's image, after his likeness, is a perfect
work of the Lord. And after God had
given to man dominion over all beasts that
are on the earth, and over all things that
move in the seas, and over all things that
soar in the air, then he rested unto the
seventh eternity. Therefore God gave
commandment to man. Thus said he:
Remember the Sabbath day to keep it
holy. And thus it becomes very much to
man from generation to generation that he
learn to remember the seventh day and
to hallow it. And God said unto man
This Sabbath be a sign unto you of the
covenant that is established between me


---

## Page 17

and you. And in the book of Moses it
was written that the commandment in
behalf of the Sabbath shall be kept by the
children of Israel, and by the strangers
that dwell among them.
And Godhad driven out Adam from the
garden because of his disobedience, and
thus it shall not become to the children of
Israel that they transfer the Sabbath from
the seventh day to another day of the
week. And God brought forth manna of
two-fold unto the children of Israel on the
sixth day for the following day, for the
Sabbath, but from the people some men
went out on the seventh day to gather and
found none. And the Lord said unto
Moses How long refuse ye to keep my
:
commandments and my laws ? See, for
that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath
;
therefore he giveth you on the sixth day
the bread of two days abide ye every
;
man in his place, let no man go out of his
place on the seventh day. Because of the
holiness of God appeared the Lord before
the children of Israel in cloud and fire, and

## Page 18

said Remember the Sabbath day to keep
:
it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and
do all thy work but the seventh day is a
;
Sabbath untothe Lord thy God ; in it thou
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son,
nor thy daughter, nor thy man servant,
nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor
thy stranger that is within thy gates ; for
in six days the I^ord made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the seventh day wherefore the
;
Lordblessed the Sabbath day and hallowed
it.
For these words God did not add more
things nor did he also omit anything. But
God had spoken that man, the image of
God, and his likeness shall be like the
creator, and by the time shall be perfect
from generation to generation.
And man byhis heart shall ask himself
:
What is the Sabbath of the Lord ? What
shall I do to hallow the Sabbath ? And
every man himself shall learn the reason
of the Sabbath, and when he understands
that in meeting and school he shall praise

his father, the creator, by offerings of
righteousness, by wise talk, by good works.
And when man understands the reason of
the Sabbath out from his whole soul, the
day of the Sabbath shall be unto man like
the day of delight, like time of hallelujah.
And Christ said to his brethren, the
Jews, the Sabbath is for man's sake, the
man is not for Sabbath's sake, and thus the
son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.
And when man understands the reason
of the Sabbath fully he will hallow that
day with joy, and thus man is Lord of the
Sabbath. God, for his image's sake, for
man's sake, had labored six eternities with
a great deal of pain and sorrow, and after
he created man perfectly he rested on
the seventh eternity. Therefore God
commanded that following after the fourth
commandment to man, thus it is : Honor
thy father and thy mother, that thy days
may be long upon the land which the
Lord thy God giveth thee. And man was
created in the image of God. And after
man had begotten his child with pain and

sorrow, this child himself shall know how
much it becomes for him to honor his
father and his mother, but when the child
does evil before his father the latter shall
be stricken with pain and sorrow, and thus
God shall be stricken with pain and sor-
row when man does evil before his creator.
This history ought not to be forgotten, as
follows And when men began to multiply
:
on the face of the earth, and daughters
were born unto them, the children of God
saw the daughters of men that they were
fair and they took them wives of all that
:
they choose. And the Lord said. My
spirit shall not strive with man forever,
for that he also is flesh yet shall his days
;
be a hundred and twenty years. Monsters
of men were on the earth in those days,
and also after that, when the sons of God
came in unto the daughters of men, and
they bare children to them the same were
;
the mighty men which were of old, men
of renown. And the Lord saw that the
wickedness of man was great in the earth,
and that every imagined thought of his

heart was only evil continually. And it
repented the Lord that he had made man
on the earth, and it grieved him at his
heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy
man whom 1 have created from the face of
the ground both man, and beast, and
;
creeping thing, and fowl of the air for it
;
repents me that I have made them. But
Noah found grace before the Lord, for
Noah was a righteous man, was perfect
amidst his generation, and walked with
God. When God thought to annihilate
man by the flood of waters it grieved him
exceedingly at his heart, for man, the
likeness of God, was created after six eter-
nities with a great deal of pain and sorrow,
for God expected from his son, the man,
that he walk with God and be perfect
after the spirit of his creator. And,
behold, the earth was corrupt before God,
and the earth was filled with violence.
And God saw the earth, and, behold, it
was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted
his way upon the earth. And God was in
his heart exceedinglyaggrieved, for onthat

cause he was hindered to rest his Sabbath,
and for the men, the children of God had
perverted the way of their creator by-
wickedness and violence, and had polluted
the Sabbath of the Lord foully.
Before the flood of waters after Adam
there were several wise men that preached
before their people the word of the Lord
and out from them was Enoch, called in
the book of Moses. Many books were lost
by the flood of waters that were taught by
God to wise men, in order to teach other
men for good works.
Adam was brought up in the beautiful
garden, for he was like a little child
before the Lord. And when Adam pros-
pered in body and spirit, his father, the
Lord, brought the beast of the field and
the fowl of the air unto him that he
should learn dominion over them. And
among these animals was the serpent,
called in the Pentateuch, thus it is: And
the serpent was more subtle than any
beast of the field which the Lord God had
made.

PREFACE.
The Bible is a common property of man-
kind, a sanctuary in every household.
But many say, the old reverend book is
pretty well worn out because of breeding
of modern intellect and thought among
mankind.
And the other many mourn it, the decay
of the religious tower. But all this is not
the fault of the Lord, but of men, because
they clothe the pillar of religion with
rubbish of human convenience and with
rust of narrow mind.
The anonymous Author, it seems to the
translator, has stretched forth his hand to
purify the old Bible from all the atmos-
phere that ought not to envelope it, to the
injury of modern mankind at large; the
'-'- New Bible," or New Pentateuch, as the
reader may choose to call it, sets forth to

It bears witness against all, and at the
same time divides favor unto all alike,
regardless of birth and race.
The Great Problems that are set up
ever before mankind are treated in the
'' New Bible " as follows
:
How was the creation by God in the
six days of the Lord ?
What means the sabbath of God in the
seventh day of the Lord ?
Who were the races that reigned there
Adam
before ?
Why were Adam and Eve called the
parents of present mankind ?
How was woman created of man ?
Was the sin of Adam a curse for man-
kind?
Who was the serpent who was there
with Adam ?
What was the Great Sign of God unto
Cain that nobody shall punish him for his
fratricide?
Who were the children of God on earth
up to Noah's time, up to the flood?

Whatmeans the righteousnessof Enoch ?
Who was Noah, the builder of the
Great Ark ?
What natural causes led to the great

The first Ethiopian volume, as written
by the anonymous Author, holds a short
review about the known stories from the
creation up to the building of Babel, and
scatters here and there new passages and
stories, but the other seven volumes dwell
exclusively on the lost ages up to the time
of Noah.

And the earth was created under the
soaring fires of the third eternity, and
brought forth the grass and the tree
wherein is seed that grew from a little
seed. But for the earth's sake, for
herself's sake, two great lights were fin-
nished to give light upon the earth, and
signs for day, season, and years. And the
stars were made after the spirit of God,
but on the endless face of heaven a great
many firmaments were created like the
earth, and of them there is no end. And
these firmaments were called stars like the
earth. And unto the Lord from eternity
to eternity there is no Sabbath because of
the creation of new stars. But for this
earth, after God had created man on the
face thereof, unto the Lord there was
Sabbath in the time of the seventh
eternity. Therefore this reason will be
very well understood how God did not say
that the creation of heaven firmaments
which he made in the second eternity was
good, and how the book of Moses was
silent on this matter.

From the midst of the fourth eternity
until the beginning of the fifth eternity
the seed of fish moved in the water, hav-
ing living soul, and from this little seed
many fishes grew and multiplied, and at
the last time great sea monsters became
living inside of the water, and also from
the water the seed of fowl came; and
afterwards the fowl began to soar under
the heaven, and the creation of them was
by the warmth of the sun finished at the
end of the fifth eternity. From the midst
of the fifth eternity until the beginning
of the sixth eternity, because of the
warmth of the sun, the seed of worm came
from the water, and thereafter the creep-
ing thing began to move upon the earth,
and from this creeping thing out the beast
of the field grew living after its kind, and
unto theircompletion grew pursuant to the
spirit of God.
In the midst of the sixth eternity, from
the monkey out, the seed of man began to
grow, and in a warm and good country

pursuant to the spirit of God. And before
Adam the likenesses of man were destroyed
from the face of the earth pursuant to the
spirit of God. And when Adam became
living in the garden at the end of the
sixth eternity, God saw that man, the
likeness of God, of the image of his father,
was good. And, blessing man, he gave to
him dominion over the beast of the field.
And God again saw the creation of six
eternities, and, behold, all this was very
good, and in the seventh eternity, sitting
on the throne of heaven, he rested.
Therefore God said by the hand of the
wise and prophets to the children of Israel
that they shall remember to hallow the
Sabbath of the Lord. And concerning the
coming time of the earth God expected
that through the hand of Israel man be
perfect in his spirit pursuant to God's
spirit. And the perfection of the spirit
that is in man is a great, and hard, and
quite painful work before the Lord, but
men shall struggle one with another by
a great deal of wickedness and trouble for

several times, and among men intellect,
and knowledge shall multiply, and hence-
forth the longing of God for man's per-
fection will be fulfilled at that time.
From the remains of animals and creep-
ing things there were some living until the
birth of Adam, having language of man,
and thus the serpent was playing before
Adam and his wife in the garden like
other animals which God had brought to
them. Adam and his wife liked the ser-
pent, for he was more subtle than other
animals. The serpent and other animals
that were in the garden were stricken
with fear before Adam and his wife pur-
suant to God's spirit. Adam and his wife
were themselves naked, but they learned
dominion over these animals. And the
parents of Adam, and also the parents of
his wife, with those together, perished at a
former time from the face of the earth,
pursuant to the spirit of God, for they
were not able to understand the rights and
commandments of the Lord. And after
the creeping thing had multiplied on the

## Page 33

THE LOST AGES. 21
earth under the sun, two sexes came in the
fifth eternity time which were called male
and female, and because of the holiness of
God thus a short word was written in the
Pentateuch concerning the creation of
Adam and his wife, that the generation of
Adam and Noah shall understand this
word by their child-like spirit and shall
learn the fear of their father, God.
From the rib of the male creeping thing
went forth the female creeping thing at
the time of sleepingin its lustfulness. And
on this account the word of the Pentateuch
will be understood concerning the creation
of Adam and his wife.
And when the creeping thing began to
move under the heat of the sun these took
by little and little to feeling, and there-
after smelling entered through its nostrils,
and these became living souls pursuant of
God's spirit. And the creeping things
without number were perishing at the
time of sunset, and thereof remained few
that could grow pursuant to God's spirit.
And these creeping things had a good

smelling, but these were blind, without
eyes, and when these raised their nostrils
unto the sun, these, by means of hard
longing took to seeing and at that time
;
fear went forth over these creeping things
because of the hard struggle that was
among them, and thus by little and little
took to good hearing. And from these
creeping things the fowl of the air, the
beast of the field, and cattle all went forth
after its kind from the fifth eternity until
the sixth eternity.
And Adam was the first man who re-
ceived the first right, and commandment
by God, his father. But the serpent and
other beasts from the lost generation hav-
ing man's language, and likeness of man
were playing near by of Adam and his
wife in the garden, but the likeness of
God had not yet come upon them and
;
therefore they served to Adam and his
wife with fear. And God brought some
of these remaining animals into the gar-
den to tempt man.
And Adam and his wife grew very

## Page 35

THE LOST AGES. 23
largely in their body, and also had veiy
much strength, and therefore all beasts
which were near by them feared Adam
and his wife.
But after Noah's time men began to
diminish in their bodies, and also their
lifetime became short pursuant to God's
spirit. And this case was so, for intellect
and knowledge multiplied among men that
they may have dominion over all animals
that are on the earth and in the sea.
The serpent ate from the fruit of the
tree, but not from dast of the earth he
;
ate with his master Adam, and his wife
together in the garden, but Eve liked the
serpent much, and told to him the com-
mandment of God. And the serpent hav-
ing yet not the likeness of God had evil,
ajid subtle thoughts, and also ate before
Eve from the fruit of the tree which God
had commanded to man not to eat from.
And the knowledge of Adam to distinguish
between good and evil was still hidden, and
pursuant to God's wisdom, was opened by
the mouth of the serpent. Adam and his

wife were from their race the first, who be-
came aware of their nakedness they
;
sewed fig-leaves together, and thus made
themselves aprons. The friendship that
was then between Eve and the serpent
changed into bitter enmity pursuant to
God's spirit. The likeness of the serpent
is sin, for it is of the likeness of man, but
not of God. And therefore it will be
understood that the thought of God be
perfectly high and sublime before the
children of men. Thus said he
:
Thou sin, I will put enmity between thee
and man, between thy seed, and his seed ; it
shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
bruise his heel. And when God saw how
Adam and his wife after the likeness
of God knew good and evil and put
aprons over their nakedness, thus said
he : Behold, the man is become as one of
us, to know good and evil, and now, lest he
put forth his hand, and take also of the
tree of life and eat, and live forever,
therefore Godthe Lord sent him forth from
the garden of Eden to till the earth where-

on he was created. But according to the
wisdom of God, the disobedience of Adam
was going to good, and became a great
blessing for the children of Adam. And it
is the will of God the creator, that the
children of Adam shall till the earth, and
thus struggling with sorrow and need, shall
walk until to the likeness of God, for he
had created the earth and all that is in the
earth in six eternities, with a great deal of
pain and sorrow. And God did his father-
hood unto Adam and his wife, and when
.
he drove them out of the garden he made
for them coats of skin, and clothed them.
And Adam begat many children, and his
children began to multiply, and desired
very eagerly to multiply from time to time
exceedingly, that they might take posses-
sion of the whole eailh. And this great
eagerness will be understood concerning
the daughters of Lot who thought all men
being destroyed from the face of the earth,
and thus bare children to their father.
The word of God that is wi-itten in the
Pentateuch, thus said he The thought of

man's heart is evil from his youth even
;
this shall not be forgotten.
And so was his first-born son who
was called Cain he slew his brother Abel
;
for jealousy, and also repented for his evil
deed, and took from Adam's daughters one
as his wife, and parting from his father he
went forth into a far off countiy.
After Cain had parted from his fattier,
Seth became before Adam his first-born
son. The great sorrow of God ought not
to be forgotten forever, when he thought
to destroy the people of Adam by the
flood of waters, even the work of six etej*-
nities, the crown of his creation : it grieved
the Lord in his heart exceedingly, for all
the men who were on the earth, contrary
to God's spirit, filled the earth with evil
and violence. And God was aggrieved in
his heart, for the Lord asked, to his holiness
and his justice, the question whether the
work of sixeternities shall be destroyed in
a moment, by forty days' flood of waters
from theface of theearth. Henceforth the
word of God spoken by hand of the

prophet, Isaiah ix, 12, will be so well
understood how he said I will make man
:
more worth than fine gold, even the man
more praised than the gold of Ophir.
And the Lord rejoiced when he saw
Noah being a wise man who walked after
the spirit of God, but God counted for the
lost men again one hundred and twenty-
years that they shall hearken to the voice
of Noah; and in face of this people he
built his ark. And Noah bought from this
people wives for his three sons, and also
took servants in sufficientnumberthat they
help him to finish his ark. And those men
were bought as slaves, and it may be per-
haps that Noah could not buy maid ser-
vants for them because of the jealousy of
the chiefs and men of raak. And thence-
forth these servants dwelt with Noah and
his sons together in the ark, when the
flood of waters fell upon the earth. And
the Pentateuch told a short word that at
the time of Noah many men were by their
names known for their strength, for their
cunning they thought themselves as the

children of God and mighty men, and be-
cause of their great lustfulness they
polluted themselves with all beasts that
may bring forth strange seed, and that
they may multiply perception and knowl-
edge concerning the creation of the
stranger seed. And thereafter they did not
know the meaning of sin. And when God
brought forth in the heart of Adam andhis
wife the knowledge of good and evil it was
good before the eyes of the Lord, but their
children destroyed the probation of heart
entirely, even the spirit of God, and put-
ting this to scorn and laughter, they
filled the face of the whole country with
their pollution and with their violence.
Henceforth the word of the Lord spoken
by the hand of Isaiah v. will be fully
understood. So said he
Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song
of my beloved touching his vineyard. My
wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fat
hill, and he digged a trench about it, and
gathered the stones out thereof, and
planted it with the choicest vines, and

THE LOST AGES. 29
built a tower in the midst of it, and also
hewed out a winepress therein and he
:
looked that it should bring forth grapes,
and why brought it forth wild grapes ?
And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, be-
twixt me and my wellbeloved. What
should have been done more to my vine-
yard that I havenot done to it? Wherefore
when I looked that it should bring forth
grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? And
now, I will show, tell you what I will do
to my vineyard: I will take away the
hedge thereof, and itshall be to pasturage
I shall break down the fence thereof, and
it shall be trodden down ; and I will lay it
waste it shall not be pruned nor hoed,
;
but there shall come up briers and thorns;
I will also command the clouds that they
rain no rain upon it. For the vineyard of
the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel,
and the men of Judah his plant of delight.
And he looked for judgment, but behold,
shedding of blood wasthere for righteous-
;
ness, but behold, cry was there.

But Noah built before his people a great
ship pursuant to God's word, and took
from all animals, and from all living things
that were on the face of the earth the male
and female, and brought them into the
ship. And this strange work became in
the mouth of all his people the object of
laughter and mockery.
The word of Christ on the flood of
waters shall not be forgotten. The flood
of waters fell suddenly upon the people of
Noah; and all beasts remaining at the time
of Adam's birth, and having likeness of
man perished in the waters with all men,
and all living souls that were on the face
of the earth together, and also great beasts
terrible with their figures, and from which
Noah had not taken any one after God's
command died.

When the flood of waters ceased, the
sun arose, and behold, on the heaven there

colors, and it shone upon the earth many
days as long as the sun rose each day till

earth. And Noah and his children
and their servants were witnesses of the
bow of the Lord. According to the child-
like spirit of men the Lord God said unto
Noah, and unto his sons with him, so is it :
And I, behold I establish my covenant
with you, and with your seed after you,
and with every living creature that is with
you, the fowl, the cattle, and every beast
of the earth with you of all that go out
;
of the ark, even every beast of the earth.
And I will establish mycovenant withyou
;
neither shall all flesh be cut off any more
by the waters of the flood neither shall
;
there any more be a flood to destroy the
earth. And thence God said
:
This is the token of the covenant which
I make between me and you, and every
living creature that is with you, forever.
I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall
be for a token of the covenant between me
and the earth. And when I shall cover
the heaven with the cloud over the earth
my bow shall be seenin the cload, and I will
remember m}^ covenant which is between

meaiid you and every living creature of all
flesh and the waters of the flood shall no
;
more be there again to destroy all that is
clothed by flesh. And the bow shall be
in the cloud, and I will look upon it that I
may remember the everlasting covenant
between God and every creature that has
living soul, andthat is clothed with flesh on
the earth.
And God said unto Noah : This is the
token of the covenant which I have
set up between me and all over llie earth
that is clothed by flesh.
The bow of God is in truth the hope of
the Lord, for he foresaw the good that
shall come from the seed of Noah, and
even for this the Lord expected that at the
coming time all men shall understand the
ways of God's spirit, and shall from their
heart choose and love, to walk in the way
of judgment, and righteousness.
And henceforth the waters of the flood
shall not be there a second time, forever,
but when God rises to judge over the earth,
thefireofhiswrathshall burnupontheearth.

The covenant of the heart's language is
established between the child, and his
father, and his mother, between man and
man and when the man and his wife be-
;
gat the child, a strong covenant was there
between them, and henceforth the covenant
of the Lord which is established with all
living souls, with man and animals that
were created from since six eternities, will
be well understood. And the man loving
his wife knew her, and she conceived, and
bare to him a child with pain and sorrow,
and when the man saw how this child was
after his image he loved it, and they both
guarded the child with pain and sorrow,
and when the child knew his parents a
strong covenant was there in their hearts
between themselves. And when the
animals brought forth the young upon the
earth, the mother loved her young from all
her soul, but when the young grew, it went
forth from the side of the mother, and
also the mother sent it off at the time of
its growing.
And thus God after six eternities full of

## Page 46

pain and sorrow created Adam, thelikeness
of the Lord, and gave to man right and
command for life, that it may take root in
his heart, and stay in man's heart. And
it is the full longing of God to rest, to
dwell in man's heart. And it is not upon
the elevated height nor in the handsome
house, be it from fine stone, be it from
costly gold. And this is the Sabbath of
the Lord, that his likeness, the children of
man, shall know the good work of God
their father, by their hearts, and guard it,
and shall praise the wonderful creation of
God by exploring it from all their soul.
Therefore God on the seventh day had
given to man the Sabbath, that man shall
from time to time learn the meaning
of the Sabbath. And the Sabbath of God
shall be kept within the heart of man
from child to his child, for after God had
fought and conquered the darkness and
emptiness in six eternities with a great
deal of pain and sorrow that shall never be
comprehended by man, even in the seventh
eternity, there was Sabbath unto the Lord.


---

## Page 47

THE LOST AGES. S5
And this is the Sabbath of the Lord that
the everlasting life which he gave unto
man, the likeness of God, had conquered
the darkness, and emptiness. Henceforth
it shall become very much to every man to
keep the Sabbath holy from week to week
after the thought of his heart, after the
advice of wise men. And this is the bow
of the Lord that is seen in the cloud, for
ever, that the living of man, the everlast-
ing life, is established before the face of
the Lord,
Prior to the time of Noah there were
several languages spoken among men but
;
after the flood of waters, Noah, three sons
with him, their wives and their servants
remained on the earth.
Therefore Noah was called the father of
all man's seed. And after Noah the whole
earth was of one language, and of one
speech. And the children of Noah knew
that their multiplication over the earth
shall bring s(^attering surely and thus they
thought to hinder tlieir scattering by the
building of a tower which shall go up unto

heaven. And the Lord came down to see
the city, and the tower, which the children
of Adam built. And the Lord said, Be-
hold they are one people and they have all
one language, and this is what they begin
to do and now shall it not be withholden
;
from them which they purpose to do. Go
to, let us go down, and there confound
their language that they may not under-
stand one his next's speech. And the
Lord raised among them fiery jealousy, and
in that country was fiery strife, but Nim-
rod who was called a mighty hunter before
the Lord, conquered his enemy, and built
Babel thereon. Many families of Noah's
generation being conquered withdrew be-
fore Nimrod far off that they might seek
good country, and dwell therein, but their
children after much time were changing,
and forgetting the language of Noah. And
thus it will be understood, this is the will
of God, that men shall fill the earth for
dominion, and that their language shall
vary among them, and that for this cause
intellect and knowledge shall multiply

God, before Adam and his wife destroyed
theirparents,the likenessesofman,fromthe
earih, for the likeness of God had not yet
come upon them. And from the sons of
Adam he took Noah, and made him again
the father of man, by the token of his
covenant, for God expected to see for man
the coming of good times. And the Lord
being a true father and holy God showed
before little man, before Noah and his
children, the bow of heaven in the cloud,
and by short words said unto them This

shall not be in vain, but at ihe coming
time shall the earth be filled with man
who is fully of my likeness, and who walks
with me. And, thereafter, the Sabbath of
delight shall be unto me from eternity
until eternity. Henceforth the word of

be thus well understood ; thus it is : Art
thou jealous for my sake"^ Would God
that all the people were prophets, that the
Lord would put his spirit upon them
God is the truthful father, and the holy
God, and this the being of the Lord is seen
in the Pentateuch, and in all holy books.
And after God had finished the work of
six fternities, thus said he
:
Behold, I have
given you every herb yielding seed, which
is upon the face of all the earth, and every
tree yielding seed, and every fruit of the
tree that bears fruit, to you it shall be
for food, and to every beast of the earth
and to every fowl of the air, and to every
thing that creepeth upon theearth, wherein
thereis living soul, I have given everygreen
herb for food. And it was so. And God
saw every thing that he had made, andf
behold it was very good. And there was
evening and there was morning, sixth
eternity. Eternity, And what is this
word? Behold, the answer is found
readily. The prayer of Moses, the man of
the Lord in Psalm 90 shall be thus readj:

A
thousand years in thy sight are but as
yesterday which passeth away, and as a
watch in the night.
Unto the Lord it is an easy thing that
he create all the world by short times. In
the holy scriptures there were several
stories that the dead became living because
of the will of God. But the Lord is sub-
lime in His Godhood elevated in His
;
spirit, and in all His council there is no
vain thing.
Behold, when man with his wife begets
his likeness, when they raise up the child
by sorrow and guard it, this is the fruit of
their labor, of their painful strain unto
them, and hence it becomes being honored,
being blessed unto them. And the gold
of Ophir could not bring away the fruit of
•man, the child, out from his heart. And
when man with his wife raise up the
child several years with all their love, and
guard, it becomes a glorious work unto
them ; and it is forbidden within his heart
and within his thought, that the child, the
fruit of his labor of much time, of hia

## Page 53

THE LOST AGES. 41
sorrow, shall be good for nothing. And,
behold, the word of God ought never to be
forgotten, and it is written in the Penta-
teuch that man was created in the image
of God, in the likeness of God. And
when the child grows up strong, it becomes
thus a Sabbath unto his parents. And,
too, these parents shall bless their Sabbath
within their heart. And, thereafter, the
word of the Loid will be very well under-
stood, how it happened, that He after six
eternities of labor blessed his Sabbath, and
hallowed it, at the time of Adam's birth.
The holiness of God could not be unto
telling, unto writing within the Pentateuch
that God created all the world in six
eternities. At that former time the intel-
lect of man was still hidden before the face
of the Lord. And in the spirit of God
there is no haughty thing, but he had thus
spoken unto man, unto Adam and his
children that he had created heaven and
earth, all the being of the earth in six
days. And hj the Lord the sublime
thought was there written, that man from

generation to generation till the face
of the earth to his use, and, thereafter, till
the words of God to the light of his heart.
And when the children of Israel saw in
the wilderness themanna that rained from
heaven, they spake the one to another
:
This white thing, that lies on the
face of the wilderness, what is that ?
And Moses said unto the children of
Israel: Thisisyourbread,given bytheLord.
And the Sabbath of the Lord, that he
blessed on the seventh day and hallowed
it, wherefore is it? And for this question
the answer is here that the Lord God had
created heaven and earth in six eternities,
and the Lord had given the just command-
ment, the law of truth to man that he
remember to hallow the Sabbath of the
Lord within his hearb.
And Moses, the man of the Lord called
by his prayer like in Psalm 90, so said he
:
The time of our years is seventy years, and
even if it holds strong, eighty years, yet
their pride is but labor and sorrow, for it
is gone flighty, and we go by flying. So

## Page 55

THE LOST AGES. 43
teach us, that we bringin our heart toward
wisdom, number our days.
Therefore it becomes to every man that
he remember to hallow the Sabbath of the
Lord each week, for the lifetime of man is
short, the time of seventy years. And to
every man it is commanded that he till the
ground of the Sabbath of the Lord, that he
sow thereason of the Sabbath of God in all
the spirit of man and that he eatthe fruit of
this labor to the glory of Godtheir creator.
And when man by one moment begets
the child, it shall come well nigh that a
great many children should be unto this
man this fatherwouldbe capableto destroy
;
many children as good for nothing, and his
heart should be filled with vain thought
and cursing. And, if God created heaven
and earth, and, to the very word, the earth
alone in six days, this God could be unto
destroying of the whole earth many times
again and therefore the Sabbath of the
;
Lord should go in vain, and in man's heart
sublime thoughts for praising his God
could not take root there.

And when God saw that the wickedness
and violence of the children of Adam pre-
vailed and increased exceedingly on the
face of the earth, he was aggrieved in his
heart for he saw his Sabbath that was
after his labor of six eternities now thus
being defiled and destroyed. And again
he gave for the children of Adam one hun-
dred and twenty years that the seed of the
goodly and righteous shall be found upon
the earth in sufficient number. And when
the Lord found Noah being a righteous
man he was exceedingly delighted with
such delight, whose height man shall never
comprehend. And he saved Noah and his
children thus from the flood of waters, and
established with them an everlasting
covenant, and thereafter, the Sabbath ofthe
Lord was returning there. And the being
of the earth, and the living of man was
again good in the face of the Lord hence
;
God set up in the cloud the token of his
hope, the great bow; and this bow thus
established the Sabbath of the Lord, for
God forsaw that by the coming time of

judgment there shall stay on earth many
men being righteous.
And when God brought in man upon
the earth he sent things of the tempter in
the face of man, for in the council of God
there waswritten that man being in the
garden without labor and sorrow, shall not
be living forever. Was the playing of the
tempter withholden from the face of man
the work and creation of the Lord should
go like nothing. Hence it is thought by
the Lord that a great many men shall fall
in their struggle with the tempter and
shall fill the house of hell until over its
roof, but that few men being like fine gold,
like costly stone in the house of God shall
find there the everlasting life ; this is that
God longed for.
And the Lord by his own will let write
down throughout the Pentateuch, and the
holy books a great many things of the
tempter that man from generation to
generation shall go free whether he shall
understand the word of God or throw it
behind. Hence the sayings of wise men,

the teaching of Jesus went into truth; so it
is : Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
And in the Pentateuch there is written
about this very thing, so it is. And the
Lord God created man from the dust of
the earth and breathed in his nostrils the
breatli of life, and man became living soul.
And, behold, the poor in spirit believe
readily that word of creation, but to the
men who hold themselves as being wise
men snares are given readily by the Lord
And these men called themselves wise men
therefore they were fools before the Lord
for they talked the story of this creation
to laughter.
By the first man who was called Adam
there was a childish spirit as well as by
his children. Therefore God spake in his
true fatherhood unto Adam and his child-
ren the Pentateuch of creation, that
they shoul 1 keep and deliver the word of
God unto their generation throughout all
times. And unto the Lord it may not be
come to talk for the second time the story


---

## Page 59

THE LOST AGES. 47
of the creation unto the latter man, for
God had spoken the story of the creation
unto Adam who lived for nine hundred
and thirty years, once one time. See, a
man begat the child, and raised it up, and
thereafter told the story of Lis birth to
his child, and thus the Lord had spoken
unto his son Adam the story of the creation
one time.
This is the first commandment of God
that he gave unto man who was called
Adam Remember the day of Sabbath
:
that thou shalt hallow it. Six days shalt
thou labor, and do all thy work. But the
seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God, in it shalt thou not do all thy work,
for the Lord had created heaven and earth,
and seas and all that is in them in six days
and rested on the seventh day. Therefore
the Lord blessed the day of Sabbath and
hallowed it.
The birth of man, the day of Adam's be-
getting was Sabbath unto the Lord. There-
fore the just commandment shall come un-
to every man till forever that he remember

the birth of man, the begetting of Adam
on the seventh day each week, and say
before his father the Lord praises of
delight.
See, ye all of mankind, and hear : re-
member in your hearts, and keep it ; the
Lord your father shall have delights of
heaven when you understand the Sabbath
of the Lord, the day of your birth, and
when you make this day the day of hallelu-
jah and praises.
The mockers that are in mankind shall
do mockery about that narration of the
Pentateuch. Thus it is : God created
man of the dust of the earth, and breathed
through his nostrils the breath of life, and
man became a living soul. And also the
mockers shall mock about the creation of
Adam and his wife, for it was written in
the Pentateuch how woman was made
from the bone of man.
In this narration of the Pentateuch the
snare is there seen that shall catch the man
who loves evil and sin. And this man
refused to believe in that word of the


---

THE LOST AGES. 49
Pentateuch, and hence he was saying In
:
all the world there is no Lord nor from
the Gods any one, and I shall go ahead to
do sin, and I shall run to think evil
thoughts, for there is no Lord or God who
punishes sin.
This is the will of God that man shall
struggle with the tempter all times, and
at the end shall be there a conqueror
or a conquered. Therefore the Lord had
called every man by the name Israel, for
he had struggled with God and man, and
prevailed against them.
And in the Pentateuch, when it spoke
of the creation of heaven and earth, there
is much riddle by the Lord, that every
man shall strain his soul to lifting up, and
to investigation of that riddle. And man
became honored by his earthly work, but
he became more elevated for the labor of
his spirit, and thereafter was cumbered as
a child of the Lord.
The mockery of the mocker shall take
to holding its peace before this narration.
Thus
it is :


---

## Page 62

50 REVELATION OF GENESIS.
The spirit of God is the beginning of
all. And, thereafter, the spirit of God
moved upon the waters. On the face of
heaven there is no end. And there were
the elements of water scattered, but there
on all the face of heaven was darkness, in
the high and deep. And, the spirit of
God was moving amidst the waters. And
thereafter, the waters were awakening up,
and the flames of fire came out thereof.
And on the face of heaven the
fires moved with the waters to and fro, but
until the flames of fire multiplied in their
scattering there was first eternity. And
behold there was light in all face according
to the word of God. And when the flame
of fire came into a place there was light,
and hence was called day, but when this
flame went behind the elements of waters,
there was again darkness, and this was
called night.
In the midst of the first eternity the
seed of firmaments being made by the fires
wei'e separated from the waters, and thus
many firmaments began their existence.


---

## Page 63

THE LOST AGES. 51
And all this was before the existence of
our earth. And hence God called the
multitude of these firmaments Heaven, but
it was not written in the Pentateuch how
God saw for the creation of heaven that it
was good, for he is making forever of
many new firmaments after the existence
of our earth on the face of heaven. And
among those firmaments there was the
existence of the sun, our sun. And also
the seed of our earth began in its place its
growing. And all this was in the second
eternity.
But our earth was finished in the midst
of the third eternity, and the earth began
to bring forth all the herb wherein is the
seed, and the tree wherein is the seed, and
which bears its fruit. And all this
became good at the end of the third
eternity.
And unto our earth the exact sign of
day and year had not yet come until the
sun, and the moon, and the stars, with
them together, perfected their course in
their rising, and going down well, that

they separate upon the earth between day
and night, and that they give unto our
earth perfect signs for day, for year, for
time. And all this was in the fourth
eternity.
In the midst of the fourth eternity, the
seed of the fish wherein is living soul was
moving within the water according to the
word of God. But within the water the
seed of the fish was male, and there was
yet no female by it. Many fish and things
that moved in the water perished for their
lustfulness. And from all these one male
fell very sick by its lustfulness, and there-
after threw a bone from its body, and thus
the female seed began its growing by the
side of the male. And that male guarded
the female and begat with her the young
and all this was by the side of the water.
And from the water the seed of, the fowl
came. And the inhabitants of the water
being male began to move upon the earth,
but a great many perished, and few out of
them remained that could dwell upon the
earth and upon the water. And behind

the male the female creeping began to go
forth from the water, and begat with the
males the offspring upon the earth. And
until the offspring multiplied in seed,
there were several kinds that returned not
to the water. And from these the fowls
came forth, and began to fly under the
heaven. And God saw it that it was good.
And the multitude of the fish and fowls
grew up unto their perfection. And God
blessed them thus, saying Be fruitful and
:
multiply, and fill the watersin the seas, and
let fowl multiply on the earth.
And the creeping things that went forth
from the water perished upon the earth,
for breath was not going through their
nostrils. And few caught breath accord-
ing to the spirit of God and became living
upon the earth, but the breath was not
yet strong unto them, and they returned to
the water, but came again upon the earth
until the breath was strengthened in the
nostrils. And all this was in the fifth
eternity.
Several kinds that went forth from th^

fish got wings that they fly above the
water. And from these the seed of the
fowl went forth, but they were bound to
the water much time, until another kind
was there, that 'flew under heaven and
returned no more to the water. From the
small seed of the creeping things in the
water went forth great sea monsters after
much time, and also from the small fowl
came forth the eagle after much time.
From the creeping in whose nostrils the
breath was strengthened went forth all
beasts of the field after their kind, and the
animals of the earth after their kind.
The creation of these animals began in
the midst of the fifth eternity, and was
finished until the midst of the sixth eter-
nity by their kinds, according to the spirit
of God. And God saw it that it was good.
And God said Let us make man in our

image, after our likeness and let them

have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
over the fowl of the air, and over the
cattle, and overall the earth, and overevery
creeping thing that creepeth upon the

;
In the midst of the sixth eternity, from
the monkey the seed of man went forth,
but was perfected until the end of the
sixth eternity, being male and female,
according to the spirit of God. And
many peoples having likeness of man per-
ished out from the face of the earth, for
the likeness of God had not yet come upon
them. And when from these men Adam
and his wife came up in the garden, God
blessed them, and God said unto them
:
Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
the earth, and subdue it, and have domin-
ion over the fish of the sea, and over the
fowl of the air, and over every living thing
that moveth upon the earth. And God
said : Behold, I have given you every herb
yielding seed, which is upon the face of all
the earth, and every tree and the fruit of
the tree bringing forth fruit, and yielding
seed, to you it shall be for food, and to
every beast of the earth and to every

fowl of the air, and to every creeping
thingthat creepethupon the earth wherein
is living soul, I have given every green
herb for food, and it was so.
And God saw everything that he had
made, and, behold, it was very good. And
there was evening, and there was morning,
sixth eternity.
And throughout the Pentateuch it was
there written, six times, there was evening
and there was morning, for pach day; and
wherefore is it so?
The answer is it that before the face of
God, in the language of the Lord, one
eternity is like a day of man, for in the
language of man one eternity is there not
known.
And when man, the likeness of God,
was not yet there upon the earth, unto the
Lord there was no Sabbath. And when
God saw man having not the likeness of
God he destroyed man after his right, for
God had not yet found his Sabbath. But
when man having likeness of God was
found on the earth there was Sabbath unto

:he Lord. Therefore God blessed this day
tnd hallowed it. Within the thought of
nan eternity and the meaning of eternity
ras not known. Therefore God gave the
verlasting commandment unto man that
every man remember to hallow his Sab-
bath on the seventh day. And the Lord
is supreme in his holiness, and the heart
of the Lord is full of holy and truthful
thought. And thus the Lord appeared
unto Moses and said unto him, thus it is: I
will make all my goodness pass before
thee, and will proclaim the name of the
Lord before thee ; and I will be gracious
to whom I am gracious, and will show
mercy on whom I have mercy. Thou
canst not see my face, for mai. shall not
see me and live. And the Lord said :
Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
shalt stand upon the rock, and when my
glory passeth by I will put thee in a cleft
of the rock, and will cover thee with my
hand, until I have passed by, and I will
take away mine hand, and thou shalt see
my back, but my face shall not be seen.

And hence God spoke unto man: My
back shalt thou see, but my face shall not
be seen. And what are these words?
And it is the answer that the spirit of
God is the beginning of all, and from
since eternity until eternity he labored
and created until man was created at the
latter time. Therefore God said unto
man My back shalt thou see, but my
:
face shall not be seen.
The full longing of God is for that he
make his Sabbath in the heart of every
man. The Sabbath of the Lord was not
above in heaven, but, after he had created
man upon the earth, he wanted to rest in
the heart of every man. Thus the Sabbath
of the Lord shall be in man's heart forever.
And Moses said unto the children of
Israel, thus it is : For this day when I
bide thee commandment is not hidden nor
far off from thee. Nor is it in heaven,
when thou sayest, who could go up for us
toward heaven and bring it down to us
that we may hear and do it ? And nor is
it beyond the sea, and when thou sayest,

## Page 71

THE LOST AGES. 59
who could pass over the sea for us and
bring up it to us that we may hear and do
it? Only but the word is very near unto
thee, that thou put it in thy mouth and in
thy heart. The word of the Lord came
unto Solomon, thus said he
:
This is the house which thou art build-
ing, if thou wilt walk in my statutes and
execute my judgments, and keep all my
commandments to walk in them, then will
I establish my word with thee, which I
spake unto David, thy father. And I will
dwell among the children of Israel, and
will not forsake my people, Israel. Hence
H becomes to every man that he build his
sanctuary within his heart, for the spirit
of God is hating all wickedness. And the
spiritofGod isfilledwithholiness andtruth,
and is loving allgoodness and all judgment.
And the everlasting Sabbath of the
Lord is in the heart of the righteous man,
and the delightful resting of God is in the
thought of the goodly man. And this is
the holy secret of the Lord.

A
here given native of Hungary, he was
:
educated in the Vienna Deaf Mutes Insti-
tution, and was also a former pupil of Mr.
Greenberger, Principal of the Improved

inhabitant and citizen of the United States
under the name '' Francis Rother," while
his family name was Franz Rotter.
Being eager from his youth to become one
of the pioneers of the coming Ethiopian
civilization, he studied the Abyssinian
languages and received an invitation by
King John of Abyssinia to enter his

empire. But he was hindered from
welcomed by his Ethiopian majesty by the
war condition that prevailed there (1887-
1888.) He was called and known by the
mute society and their newspaper under
the by-word " Round World." As the
other seven volumes, being written in
Ethiopian, require much labor and are
likely to be followed by others, and ought
to be spread in many languages, the aid of
an enterprising publisher is wanted.
